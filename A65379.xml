            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Alkaheſt:</hi> For being now out of the hope of attaining to the preparation of this Liquor by other mens Books, as well as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his own <hi>De Viribus Membrorum,</hi> I betook my ſelf to other places, treating of the <hi>Circulatum mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and <hi>Specificum corroſivum</hi> (as ſynoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Terms of the <hi>Alkaheſt</hi> with ſome men) to which I added the <hi>Aqua</hi> or <hi>Oleum Salis, Aqua Comedens, Aqua Regis, Circulatum majus,</hi> and one after another, being perſwaded that ſome one only univerſal <hi>Menſtruum</hi> was intended by all, that I might find the Method of preparing this Liquor in all places compared together, which I could not in each ſeverally; but at length deſpairing, and being overcome by the manifold and almoſt incredible, yet unſucceſsful pains I took, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to decline <hi>Chymy</hi> and <hi>Medicine,</hi> as Arts too deep for my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: When behold! on a ſudden the Eyes of my Mind were opened, and I ſaw all theſe things differ, not in name only, but alſo in matter, preparation
<pb facs="tcp:59727:5"/> and uſe; ſo inſtead of one Liquor <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaheſt,</hi> which I ſought for, I found in <hi>Paracelſus</hi> many <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> with the ſeveral Uſes of them all in <hi>Medicine;</hi> now knew I how to prepare, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> diſtinguiſh things into <hi>Eſſences, Magiſteries, Aſtrums, Arcanums,</hi> and thoſe which he calls the <hi>leſs Medicines;</hi> ſo that which was in <hi>Paracelſus</hi> moſt difficult to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by others, became more clear to me than any thing elſe; and ſo I obtained the End ſooner than the Beginning: Yet the Joy from thence accrewing, fell ſhorter than expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for having tried ſeveral Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments in vain, I came to underſtand that theſe <hi>Menſtruums</hi> of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſomething abſtruſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, to be underſtood, not in the leaſt according to the Letter: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, examining them more exactly, and comparing their Qualities with the Nature of the Liquor <hi>Alkaheſt,</hi> I found a vaſt difference between it and them; for it is ſaid, There is one Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
<pb facs="tcp:59727:5"/> 
                     <hi>Alkaheſt,</hi> and that univerſal; but many are the <hi>Menſtruums</hi> of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> that indeſtructible, that deſtructible; that not mixing with Bodies, theſe abiding with them; that preſerves the Virtues of things, theſe alter them; that aſcends after the Eſſences of things in deſtillation, theſe before their diſſolutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I was at a ſtand ſometime which part to take; one while I wiſh'd for one indeſtructible Liquor, rather than many deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> ſuppoſing that one better than many; another while changing my Mind, I deſired the <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> as ſufficient for many Uſes I knew before.</p>
                  <p>Truth overcame at length, enabling me now to demonſtrate the moſt, if not all the Medicines of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in <hi>Guido</hi> and <hi>Baſilius:</hi> On the contrary, I perceived the <hi>Arcanums</hi> of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> (commonly ſo called) as prepared by that Liquor <hi>Alkaheſt,</hi> or the like, to be more and more different, yea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Authentick: wherefore
<pb facs="tcp:59727:6"/> as to the Preparation of Medicines, I began to abſtain, yea deſiſted from further enquiring into the obſcure Matter, Preparation and Uſe of that Liquor <hi>Alkaheſt,</hi> namely, that which I find deſcribed in one place of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus</hi> as a <hi>Medicine,</hi> but not in the leaſt as a <hi>Menſtruum:</hi> Which Obſtacle being removed, I found an eaſie way from <hi>Paracelſus</hi> to <hi>Lully, Baſilius,</hi> and other Philoſophers of the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, who I ſaw agreed all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly in confirmation of the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſian Menſtruums;</hi> yea Light adding Light to Light, appeared ſo clear, that their preparation, variety, ſimple and literal ſenſe ſhewed themſelves all at once, one only Word remaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, yet expreſſing the univerſal Baſis of all the <hi>Adepts,</hi> and that is <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> not <hi>Common,</hi> but <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical;</hi> which being known and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the greateſt <hi>Philoſophical, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal, Alchymical,</hi> and <hi>Magical</hi> My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the more ſecret <hi>Chymy,</hi> will be in the power of the Poſſeſſor. In
<pb facs="tcp:59727:6"/> no Books of the <hi>Adepts,</hi> hitherto known of me, have I found any thing rare, that owes not its original Being to this <hi>Spirit;</hi> ſo that I dare affirm, that whatſoever <hi>Chymical Spirits</hi> lower and higher, fixed and volatile, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do, the very ſame, and more will this our <hi>Spirit</hi> perform: This it was that moved me to employ all my Study and Endeavours, turning over every Stone in queſt of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of this <hi>Wine,</hi> and continually ruminating upon thoſe abſtruſe, and variouſly diſguis'd Terms whereby they cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, as the Key of all Philoſophy, behold the Fame of your great Name welcom'd me to <hi>Wilde,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Lithuania;</hi> and obſerving that You in expounding <hi>Natural Philoſophy,</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from all manner of Intricacy, and as the firſt and only Perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed uſing a plain and candid Series of Words in applying common Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Vulgar Chymiſtry,</hi> I rejoyced with my ſelf, thinking, What could not this great man do, if Maſter of
<pb facs="tcp:59727:7"/> the more ſecret <hi>Chymy?</hi> I reſolved with my ſelf therefore to take a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into <hi>England,</hi> for your ſake alone, that I might confer with you about the <hi>Menſtruums</hi> as well as <hi>Medicines,</hi> and other <hi>Secrets</hi> of <hi>Paracelſus;</hi> from whom alſo I promiſed to my ſelf very great Aſſiſtance in ſome other things not yet known: Nor indeed has my hope deceived me; for beſides the eaſie admiſſion, common to all Strangers and Foreigners, you have been pleas'd to vouchſafe me a more free Acceſs, received me courteouſly, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended my Studies, and thereby rais'd my Mind to greater Things: Which Favours do oblige me to Dedicate this part of my Studies to you your ſelf; Earneſtly and Humbly beſeeching you kindly to accept it, and continue your Love and Friendly Countenance to him that is and ever will be</p>

                  <p>UNder Heaven is not ſuch an Art, more promoting the honour of God, more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to Mankind, and more narrowly ſearching into the moſt profound Secrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than is our true and more than laudable <hi>Chymy.</hi> This is it which ſhews the Clemency, Wiſdom, and Omnipotence of the Creator in the Creatures; which teacheth not only Speculation, but alſo Practice and Demonſtration, the Beginning, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and end of things; which reſtoreth our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies from infinite Diſeaſes, as by common means intolerable to priſtine health, and diverts our Minds from the Cares and Anxieties of the World (the Thorns and Bryars of our Souls) to Tranquility of Life, from Pride to Humility, from the Love and Deſire of worldly Wealth to the Contempt thereof: And in a word, which raiſeth us from earth to heaven; Yet for all that may we ſay of it
<pb facs="tcp:59727:8"/> with the ſame truth, that amongſt all the Arts, which have yielded any benefit or profit to the World, there is none, by which leſs honour has hitherto accrued to God Almighty, and leſs utility to mankind; for leſt a Science of ſo great dignity and utility ſhould be too common, or ill managed by the ignorant and impious, the prudent Poſſeſſors of the ſame made it their buſineſs ſo to deſcribe it, as to make it known to their Diſciples only, but exclude unworthy altogether from it: But in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, the <hi>Adepts</hi> arriving to a greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Knowledge and Experience, invented ſometimes one, ſome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>imes another ſhorter Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in their Work, altering Fornaces, Fires, Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, Weights, yea, and the Matter it ſelf; who being thereby alſo conſtrain'd to make new Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Terms of Art, according to the new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Practice, it happened, that the Scholar of one <hi>Adept</hi> underſtood not the new Theory, much leſs the practice of another; which alſo ſometimes happened to the <hi>Adepts</hi> themſelves, thoſe eſpecially, which were under the document of ſome certain Patron in ſome particular Method and Proceſs; for they had not the power of diſcerning further than they had learnt; whereupon they commonly ſuſpected all the Notions of other men, eſpecially thoſe that differed from theirs, though in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves good and right, as fallacious and contrary to Nature, or applied other mens Theories, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and Terms of Art unknown to themſelves, to their own private Proceſs, with which they were
<pb facs="tcp:59727:8"/> acquainted, as I ſhall by many Examples elſewhere declare; by which very thing they involved this Art in ſuch a Chaos of obſcurity, that hitherto neither Maſters nor Scholars have ſcarce had the power of communicating any benefit to the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed World.</p>
                  <p>It is to be wondred at, but rather lamented, to ſee ſuch imperfect Philoſophical Syſtems, as have been hitherto bequeathed to us by the Maſters of this Art, not ſeldom contradicting both Nature and themſelves, whereas the Miracles of Nature might by virtue of this Art have been truly and plainly without any convulſion or contraction of words expreſſed; in which reſpect I dare, with Philoſophical Licence here affirm, that moſt of the <hi>Adepts</hi> have by their Writings declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the World better <hi>Chymiſts</hi> than <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For what I pray could they have better done in Medicine, than to have applied themſelves to this Subject, imitating the diligence and induſtry of <hi>Paracelſus?</hi> But alas! amongſt all, I find perhaps three or four, who have been careful and cordial herein; and therefore the leſs to be admired, that this noble and neceſſary Art, has made no greater progreſs, witneſs Common Chymiſtry, where the names of famous Medicines are noiſed about, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being unknown, and Shells given for Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels.</p>
                  <p>Lately indeed we had not only hope, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes alſo from the Roſy-Crucian Fraternity, as if
<pb facs="tcp:59727:9"/> they had a mind to make this our Age more happy by their Studies; but no effect being hitherto heard of, we cannot but fear, their fair promiſes will never be performed.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, Experience teacheth, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of an univerſal good derived from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of this Art, the World hath rather been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved by it in great and many Miſeries: for the <hi>Adepts</hi> affirming, yea more than often with oaths confirming, that they in their Writings treated more clearly and truly of the Art, than any other Philoſophers, have thereby inſtigated many young Novices of all Degrees and Faculties, to begin their Chymical Labours according to the Method of their Preſcriptions, expoſing themſelves not only to intolerable Expences, but alſo being as it were obſtinate in a certain confidence of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Authors genuine meaning, do rather die amongſt the Coals and Fornaces, than recede from their Imaginations, once imprinted in them for true: Whereupon ſome of the more Learned Inquirers ruminating with themſelves, how rarely, and with what great difficulty ſome of the <hi>Adepts</hi> attained to the Art by the reading of Books only, thought it a point of Prudence to deſert the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, together with their Books, perſwading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be able to find out a nearer and eaſier way by virtue of their own Genius and Reaſon, trying, repeating, altering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Experiments and Concluſions; but herein were they diſappointed of their deſired ſucceſs, no leſs than as a Mariner
<pb facs="tcp:59727:9"/> ſayling without a Compaſs, and ſo ſuch Inquirers would have acted more adviſedly, if they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in themſelves, whether they had overcome all the Difficulties obvious to them, before they applied themſelves to this more ſecret Art, and doubtleſs many of them would have hearkned to the Counſel of <hi>Theobald</hi> of <hi>Hohenland</hi> (who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly deſcribed the Difficulties of this Art collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of Philoſophers Books) and avoided it, as worſe than the Plague, or a Serpent: <hi>For who of you</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>intending to build a Tower, will not firſt ſit down, and compute the Charge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he has wherewith to finiſh it, leſt having laid the Foundation, and not being able to perfect it, all that beheld it, ſhould begin to deride him, ſaying, That man began to build, and could not finiſh the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Luke 14.38.</p>
                  <p>But I am ſenſible that theſe Admonitions will rather be ſlighted than accepted, eſpecially by thoſe who are loath to have the magnificent Towers built by themſelves in the Air, demoliſhed: For notwithſtanding the impoſſibility of removing the aforeſaid difficulties by ſome men, they endeavour to perſwade others, that they can teach them, what as yet they know not themſelves, and ſo will rather perſiſt in deceiving, than deſiſt from that which they know to be Weakneſs and Error: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers think themſelves very able to overcome all manner of difficulties, and therefore it is in vain to diſſwade them from this Art: Others indeed perceiving all the difficulties, and an undoubted
<pb facs="tcp:59727:10"/> incapacity in themſelves of facilitating them, are, though free from all fraud and arrogance, yet by ſome natural or ſecret impulſe ſo incited to this Art, as not to be driven from it by any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore having a ſenſe of the frailty which mankind is afflicted with, to them will I dedicate my Studies relating to Medicine. Deceivers I will reſtrain, ſhame thoſe that aſcribe more to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves than due; but the true Diſciples of this Art, I will lead by the hand, that they may not for the future be ſubject to the deriſion, reproaches and ſcoffs of Satyrs, together with the loſs of health, as well of Mind as Body, and at length verifie in themſelves the lamentable Prediction of <hi>Geber,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Moſt miſerable and unhappy is he, whom, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the end of his work, God denies to ſee the Truth, for he ends his Life in Error; who being conſtituted in perpetual labour, and ſurrounded with all manner of Misfortune and Infelicity, loſeth all the Comfort and Joy of this World, and ſpends his Life in Sorrow, without any benefit or reward,</hi> Lib. 2. Inveſt. cap. 38. So with the ſame Argument will I vindicate this the beſt of Arts from the Injuries of Defamers, who being deceived, by not knowing the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, accuſe it as fraudulent, impoſſible, and ſo ridiculous, as that they deter the Lovers of it, and incite them to vilifie all the demonſtrations and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Teſtimonies of the ſame; and laſtly, That the Honour and Glory of God hitherto buried in the Aſhes of it, may from thence riſe again, as a
<pb facs="tcp:59727:10"/> Phoenix, I will ſet before your eyes, that which you have not been hitherto able to find in ſo many Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of this Art, namely, <hi>Diana</hi> naked, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Cloaths; that is, I will take from her Face and Body, the Vizards of Tropes, Figures, Parables, barbarous Names, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which ſhe hath been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto diſguiſed, leſt ſhe ſhould be obvious to the knowledge of wicked men. I will expoſe <hi>Diana</hi> to you, namely, the <hi>very Truth</hi> of our Art (with ſo much ſtudy and labour ſought in vain) not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered indeed ſo much as with the Veyl of neceſſary expreſſion, but her moſt ſecret parts ſhall be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to your view, concerning which the <hi>Adepts</hi> gave exceeding caution to their Diſciples, adding a Curſe withal, not to divulge them to the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Rabble. Wherefore if you deſire to know the <hi>Menſtruums</hi> of <hi>Diana,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Adepts</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared their Philters, the Liquors of Life and Death, if you would know the way how they prepared their Tinctures, either univerſal or particular for Metals; if laſtly, you covet to know how they made pretious Stones, Pearls, perpetual Lights, together with other Secrets of the Art, read the Receipts of the four Books following; Receipts I ſay, which were either not underſtood, or altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlighted by almoſt all of you, becauſe of the ruggedneſs of their Style, which ſometimes alſo you eſteemed vain, falſe, and impoſſible, compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a manner meerly to deceive you; yet moſt true, collected not out of trivial vulgar Chymiſtry, but out of the beſt Books of the beſt <hi>Adepts,</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:59727:11"/> Treaſury of <hi>Diana;</hi> Receipts, I ſay, ſo concatena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and elaborated by as well the congruity, as wonderful dexterity of the Maſters, that where you take away or deny one of them, you cannot but reject all the reſt as falſe: on the contrary, he that owns one amongſt all to be true, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute all the reſt true; and conſequently vindicate the Authors of them, our moſt venerable Maſters from all the Infamy of Lying and Scurrility. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety ſpringing out of Unity, the Fountain of Truth, and returning into it, as into its Ocean, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrates the excellency of thoſe Receipts: I could never yet ſatisfie my ſelf, whether there be infinite, or only one Receipt in our Chymy, divided into divers parts, and deſigned for ſeveral Uſes: Variety I obſerve in the various and diſtinct parts of theſe four Treatiſes, but Unity in every part, yea in the Individual of every Part, you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways find three confirming one Treatiſe: In the the Firſt Book of <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> you will find alſo the Medicines of the Second, and Alchymical Tinctures of the Third, and Secrets of the Fourth Book; which very thing is alſo to be underſtood of the Second, Third and Fourth Books. Laſtly, Theſe Receipts are not only true, but alſo clear, deſcribed by plain and common Words, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not only according to the Letter, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by their clearneſs, illuſtrating and explaining Places more obſcure otherwiſe not intelligible, ſo that by one only Proceſs you will ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain more than ten Theoretical Books, never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable but by this Light.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:59727:11"/>
                  <p>Now theſe Receipts I was willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to you, ye <hi>indefatigable Students</hi> of this Art, for the Reaſons already given, as alſo that you may throughly apprehend the <hi>abſolute neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Lully</hi>'s <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> in our <hi>Chymy,</hi> before I treat with you concerning the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it. No man deſires that which is unknown to him, or purſues that which he knows not the benefit of: Wherefore I was deſirous firſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the <hi>ſeveral <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> of this Spirit by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of the <hi>Adepts,</hi> which if you find true, they will be of ſuch ſervice to you hereafter, as to be much to your detriment to be without them; but if falſe, ſlight and give no credit to them, but accuſe the Maſters, the Authors of them, of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Deceit and Villany; but ſuch wickedneſs I never expect from you, whatſoever Adverſaries, the blind and ignorant of this Art, will do, we little regard, and if a <hi>Zoilus</hi> or <hi>Momus</hi> appear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Cuſtom, let him chaw the Shell, that is, the homely Style, the ſlender and ſlight Obſervations and Concluſions given upon the Receipts, all which we give him freely; but touch the <hi>Kernel</hi> he cannot.</p>
                  <p>But if either now or hereafter you reap any joy or benefit by the ſight of <hi>Diana,</hi> attribute it not to <hi>Diana,</hi> though of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> nor to me, but to God Almighty, who hath by his Light brought us out of this <hi>Cimmerian</hi> Darkneſs: The time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will come, wherein I may be further uſeful and aſſiſtant, in procuring liberty for you to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<pb facs="tcp:59727:12"/> 
                     <hi>Diana</hi> in your Arms, as alſo diſcourſe fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly with her concerning her <hi>Doves, Foreſt, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Milk, Aqua vitoe,</hi> &amp;c. for at preſent you read the Inſcription upon her Forehead, <hi>Touch me not.</hi> Wherefore I adviſe you, not to touch the Secrets of <hi>Diana</hi> unleſs you have to try the Fate and Fortune of <hi>Acteon.</hi>

                  <p>You will ſcarce believe me, ſhould I affirm, that the Secrets of the <hi>Adepts</hi> are to be underſtood and prepared according to the Letter; if you argue it to be improbable that the <hi>Adepts</hi> ſhould have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their Myſteries to the view of all men, they themſelves having advertiſed you of the contrary.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Is not this our Art,</hi> ſaith <hi>Arteſius, cabaliſtical, and full of Myſteries?

<pb facs="tcp:59727:13"/> is the diſſipation of Riches. For,</hi> ſaith <hi>Geber, Where we ſpoke moſt openly we conceal'd the Art, ſpeaking to an Artiſt not Aenigmatically, but in a plain ſeries of Diſcourſe.</hi> Yea <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> proceeds further, ſaying, <hi>When I ſwear I ſay true, believe it a lie, that is, as to the Letter, and therefore when I tell you of</hi> Stalks, <hi>underſtand</hi> Lead, &amp;c. <hi>lib de Arte Chymica,</hi> pag. 56. <hi>All that I ſay is falſe, therefore nothing I ſay is true; wherefore I pray, believe me not; but when I ſay true, take it to be falſe; and if this, the contrary: So that which is falſe will be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into true, and that which is true, into falſe: I tell you theſe things, that you may beware of things that are to be avoided, and believe things credible, in writing properly, I write not,</hi> &amp;c. p. 301. <hi>And though I ſay, Take this and this, believe me not, operate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Blood, that is, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and ſo of all; leave off Experiments; apprehend my meaning, and you will find, believe me being already a lighted Candle,</hi> pag. 345.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and the like may you alleadge to confirm your Opinion; but give me leave to ſuggeſt to you the diſtinction that is to be made between the Theoretical and Practical Books of the <hi>Adepts:</hi> In the Theoretical Books there is ſcarce any thing to be underſtood literally, all things being paraboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, aenigmatical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in the Practical Books all things are clear and intelligible, according to the Letter: <hi>Philoſophical Wine</hi> alone excepted, the foundation and beginning of all Secrets: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Take the <hi>magnum Teſtamentum</hi> of <hi>Lully,</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:59727:14"/> the Theoretical part of which, is Philoſophically, that is, by various Sophiſms, deſcribed the <hi>Nature, Matter,</hi> and <hi>Preparation</hi> of <hi>Lully</hi>'s <hi>Wine;</hi> but in the Practical part of this <hi>Teſtamentum,</hi> the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of this <hi>Wine</hi> is declared according to the Letter: From hence will you alſo eaſily obſerve, That thoſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>depts</hi> which reject the Literal Senſe are rather Theoretical than Practical: We treating at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the practice of the <hi>Adepts,</hi> or the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of <hi>Philoſophical Wine,</hi> will prove that moſt of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets delivered to us by them, are according to the Letter.</p>
                  <p>But ſome of you will urge, that the <hi>Adepts</hi> themſelves have even more than often declamed againſt the Literal Sence of Practice, againſt the very Deſcriptions (commonly called Receipts) of Experiments; but let theſe our Companions know, the <hi>Adepts</hi> wrote againſt two ſorts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts.</p>
                  <p>The firſt comprehends the Receipts of Smoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, Deceivers, wicked men, who pretend they either had them from the Diſciple of ſome <hi>Adept,</hi> or found them in the Walls of ſome old Cloiſter or Sepulcher; againſt whom hear <hi>Dionyſius Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias, Pag.</hi> 781. <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>Th. Chym.</hi> ſaying, <hi>Before I left the Colledge of Arts, I entred into familiarity and friendſhip with many other Scholars; they had divers Books of Chymical Receipts, which being lent me, I tranſcribed with very great diligence, my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Maſter, who had alſo a long time before began to labour in this Art, conſenting; ſo that before I went
<pb facs="tcp:59727:14"/> away, I had gathered a very large Book of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, I went preſently with my Maſter to the Place where I was to ſtudy Law, began to turn over my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; whereof ſome contained Projections of One up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Ten, others upon Twenty, Thirty; a Third, a half part; for the Red of eighteen Carrachs, twenty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>into Gold of Crowns, Ducats, and of the higheſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour that could be; One was to endure Melting, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Touch-ſtone, another all Tryals: Of the White likewiſe, one was to be of Ten penny, another of Eleven, another Sterling Silver, coming white out of the Fire, another white from the Touch: In ſhort, I thought if I were able to perform the leaſt of thoſe things greater felicity could not happen to me in this world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eſpecially when I read the Inſcriptions of great Perſons before ſuch Receipts; one of the Queen of</hi> Navarr, <hi>another of the Cardinal of</hi> Lorain, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, <hi>and infinite others, that by ſuch Diſguiſes and Titles, Credit might be given by unwary men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bernhard</hi> alſo complains of the ſame Receipts, <hi>pag.</hi> 771. ejuſd. Vol. <hi>If I had had,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>at firſt, all the Books, which I afterwards procured, doubtleſs I ſhould have ſooner attained to the Art, but I read no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but falſe Receipts, and erroneous Books; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides I happened to confer with none but the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Thieves, wicked Men, and Impoſtors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other ſort contains Receipts of <hi>Adepts</hi> themſelves, againſt whom ſome other <hi>Adepts</hi> have alſo ſometimes written: As for example, the ſame <hi>Bernhard,</hi> Pag. 748. Vol. Theat. Chym. ſaying,
<pb facs="tcp:59727:15"/> 
                     <hi>To withdraw the true Speculators of this Art from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Errors into the right Way, that they may not waſte their Wealth, and loſe their Labours, Name and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, inſiſting upon the falſe Receipts of Books, as thoſe of</hi> Geber, Raſis, Albertus magnus, Trames, Lumen, Canonis pandectarum, Demophon, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, <hi>and other Seducers,</hi> I <hi>will firſt declare my own Errors,</hi> &amp;c. And in pag. 750. goes on, <hi>Infinite is the number of them, whom to write is needleſs; and there is great plenty of Books written upon this Subject under Metaphorical Words and Figures, ſo as not to be eaſily underſtood by any but the Sons of Art; the reading of which, leads men out of the right way, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than directs to the Work; in the number of which, are</hi> Scotus, Arnold, Raymund, Johannes Mehung, Hortulanus Veridicus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Buſineſs therefore is to ſatisfie you, and ſay, That the Authors of the firſt ſort of Receipts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive actively, wittingly, and willingly: But the Receipts of the later ſort, written by <hi>Adepts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſeduce only paſſively: And this for two Reaſons; either in reſpect of the <hi>Adept</hi> being leſs experienced in the Art, and unacquainted with the Practice of his more Learned Conſort; for it is impoſſible for one <hi>Adept,</hi> though never ſo expert in his Method, to know the various Experiments of all the other, much leſs the peculiar Theorems, private Meditations, different Denominations of things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> formed or derived from the ſame: Or in reſpect of your ſelves, who extort from thoſe Receipts, as to the Literal Sound, more, than
<pb facs="tcp:59727:15"/> the <hi>Adepts</hi> themſelves allow, not at all obſerving that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> being once and always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, the reſt you will eaſily underſtand. <hi>For knowing this,</hi> ſaith <hi>Flammel, in his Hieroglyphicks,</hi> pag. 28. I <hi>perfected the Magiſtery eaſily; for having learnt the Preparation of the firſt Agent,</hi> I <hi>following my Book according to the Letter, could not err if</hi> I <hi>would.</hi> And a little after; <hi>Then following my Book from word to word, I made Projection.</hi> But why theſe? Plenty enough of Examples in this Treatiſe will inſtruct you in all theſe things that are to be underſtood according to the Letter, except <hi>Wine, Lunary, Vegetable Mercury,</hi> and other things ſynony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to the Matter of the <hi>Spirit of Philoſophical Wine,</hi> or things prepared by the ſame Spirit, <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Sal Harmoniack, Philoſophical Vinegar,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For this <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> being prevaricated, the <hi>Adepts</hi> knew, that all the reſt, though never ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered to the Sons of Art, could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the leaſt benefit to the Reader: Wherefore I fear not the indignation of the <hi>Adepts,</hi> nor the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema's which they thundred out againſt the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers of their Secrets, having herein done nothing more, but (to ſpeak ingenuouſly) leſs, than they themſelves. I have according to my capacity, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically digeſted thoſe things which were here and there confuſedly diſperſed, but added nothing of my own, and ſo expect neither Honour nor Thanks from you; but this only, that I may know, if our Studies pleaſe; and I ſhall ſupply thoſe things that are here wanting and deſired, ſomewhat more
<pb facs="tcp:59727:16"/> largely; for I will not refuſe to aſſiſt you yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the induſtry of my Studies: So that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remains, but upon our bended Knees to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn moſt humble Thanks to the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Lights,</hi> in vouchſafing us this Art by the Writings of his Servants, and the High Prieſts of Nature, without which it would be beyond the power of man to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to ſo great a degree of Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Now celebrate with me the Urns of our pious Maſters, who have for the Welfare of Mankind, rather diſperſed, than buried their Talents; and may you oblige your ſelves to the ſame good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, if you have any of their Writings not yet publiſhed.</p>
                  <p>Finally, It is my earneſt Suit to the <hi>Adepts</hi> now living, that they would pleaſe to employ themſelves freely in expounding Nature, correcting Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and Medicine; And laſtly, refuting all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Sects of Philoſophers, as well in the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as private Schools, for the advancement of the Glory of God, being ſingularly eminent in this Art. <hi>So be it.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, They reckon</hi> Coition; <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conception; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Impregnation; <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Birth; <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Nutriment: <hi>If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Coition, no Conception; without Conception, no Impregnation; without which no Birth can be premiſed.</hi>

                     <hi>Which Diſpoſition the Ancient</hi> Morienus <hi>himſelf confeſſeth to have been derived to him from Antiquity.</hi> Hermes, <hi>whom they call Father of the</hi> Adepts, <hi>in his</hi> Tabula Smaragdina, <hi>hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to us the Father, Mother, and Nurſe of the</hi> Chymical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant. <hi>No wonder therefore, that ſuch an Ancient and Eaſie Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as this, ſhould have found ſo eaſie an acceſs to Poſterity: it would be beſides the Intention and Scope to offer thoſe things, which might be inferred by us againſt this Analogy of Seed: Here let it ſuffice to remember only, that the greater part, as alſo the more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> Adepts, <hi>comparing the Chymical Magiſtery to the Generation of Man, did under the Notion of this</hi> Allegory, <hi>call their Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents</hi> Menſtruums, <hi>or</hi> Feminine Seed, <hi>but the Things which were to be Diſſolved,</hi> Maſculine Seed. My Son, ſaith <hi>Lully,</hi> The Vegetable Menſtruum is of the Nature of a Womans Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, becauſe a Mineral Menſtruum proceeds from it by Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,

                     <hi>(of Minerals and Metals)</hi> and is made artificially as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requireth; for it hath the property of an incorruptible Spirit, which is as a Soul, and hath the Conditions of a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, becauſe it generates and produceth Seed as a Woman; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we call our D. <hi>(Diſſolvent)</hi> Menſtrual Blood, or Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, becauſe it is Generative and Nutritive, and makes the ſaid C, and (C) <hi>(Metals)</hi> grow and increaſe, till they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into M (<hi>Sulphur of Nature,</hi> or <hi>Philoſophers Mercury</hi>) or into Q, (<hi>Tincture,</hi> or <hi>Philoſophers Stone</hi>) for as Menſtrual Blood perfects the Embryo by nouriſhing, and altering one Principle into another, and one Quantity into another, and one Form into another, yet the Principles and Quantities appearing in every Alteration, under divers Forms, differing from the firſt Forms themſelves, till a certain Subſtance appears in one entire Quantity, dependent upon ſeveral Matters, which is a Body, with Spirit and Soul, reduced into Action: And thus it is with our Infant <hi>(Philoſophers Stone)</hi> Lully, <hi>Diſtinct,</hi> 3. <hi>Can.</hi> 4. <hi>Lib. de Eſſentia,</hi> When K. <hi>(Colour)</hi> appears yellow, then let the Artiſt know, that the Body of our Infant is formed, made, and compleatly organized, and begins to be prepared for the reception of the vegetable Spirit into it, and Nature continues in that preparation till the yellow K. vaniſheth away, and a red K. <hi>(Colour)</hi> appeareth; and then may the Artiſt be aſſured that the ſaid Infant is perfect both in Body and Soul: ſo that he may let the Fire alone till it grows cold; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold, the Artiſt will find our Infant round as an Egg; which he muſt take out and purifie (for it is a hard Stone in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of many Superfluities, as the Infant of a Woman appears after Birth: <hi>Can.</hi> 11. <hi>Diſtinct.</hi> 3. <hi>Lib.

                  <p>Pariſinus, Ripley, Eſpanietus, <hi>and other later</hi> Adepts, <hi>the Diſciples of</hi> Lully, <hi>had this Analogy of Seed from him, being doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the moſt Learned of the Chymical Philoſophers.</hi> Of this living Heaven, <hi>ſaith</hi> Pariſinus, Raymund <hi>ſpeaks in his Third Book de Quinteſſentia, in the Chapter beginning, Coelum &amp; Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius noſter;</hi> Our Heaven hath the property of an incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Spirit, which is as the Soul of it, and hath the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Body in it, generating and producing Seed, as a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb facs="tcp:59727:23"/> and herein it differs from the other Principles (of the Art) It is alſo ſenſual, becauſe it is apprehended by ſenſe, namely, by ſight, taſte and ſmell, as is declared in <hi>the firſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction in the Chapter, which beginneth, Proeterea eſt principium movendi, ſcilicet, corpus ſive forma: And a little after, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idg of the aforeſaid living Heaven, he ſaith,</hi> And in this point our Underſtanding knows that D. <hi>(his living Heaven, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent)</hi> hath a Vegetable property, the ſimilitude of which, R and S <hi>(Gold and Silver)</hi> do tranſmit into the Sulphur of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is the Spirit of Metals, or Stone, or transforming Poyſon, according to the ſignification of <hi>Raymund,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification he uſeth in his <hi>Alphabetum figuroe arboris Philoſophicoe,</hi> and therein produceth this following Sentence <hi>in Capite de fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gura Quintoe Eſſentioe:</hi> As the Vegetative part of the Mother or Nurſe, tranſmits her Likeneſs into the Son, which ſhe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, which property the Son retains, ſo our Mercury. The Intention of the Philoſopher <hi>(Lully)</hi> is to demonſtrate, that the Philoſophers Sulphur, or Stone, or transforming Poyſon receives all its benefit by the excitation of the vegetative Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which is in this Divine Vegetative Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſame Author in the Continuation of his Doctrine, ſaith,</hi> And alſo the Underſtanding knows, that the ſaid Metals R, and S, <hi>(Gold and Silver)</hi> retain the property of Menſtruum, with which they extend their ſimilitudes into exotick ſubſtances, tranſmuting the ſaid ſubſtances into their own kind, which is the reaſon why we call it Vegetable Mercury; as alſo becauſe it is extracted out of Vegetables. <hi>The ſame thing at the end of the ſaid Chapter he ſpeaks afreſh:</hi> And our Underſtanding alſo knows, that principle is as a Woman conceiving the Mans Seed, and bringing forth in the ſame form and virtue, as it was in the beginning. From whence we neceſſarily conclude, that the Elements of this Stone, namely, Gold, ought to be moved by vertue of a living Quinteſſence, and the aforeſaid Vegetable Heaven, which way I have ſufficiently proved and demonſtrated. <hi>Pariſinus in Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Elucidarii, pag.</hi> 221. <hi>Vol.</hi> 6. <hi>Th.

                  <p>Ripley, <hi>having the ſame Maſter as</hi> Pariſinus, <hi>expounds this Doctrine more briefly, thus;</hi> As an Infant in the Womb of the Mother, does by the concoction of temperate heat, convert
<pb facs="tcp:59727:24"/> the Menſtruums into its own Nature and Kind, that is, into Fleſh, Blood, Bones, yea, Life, with all other Properties of a living Body; ſo if you have the Water of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> it will attract other Bodies to its kind, and make their Humors perfect by its intrinſick Virtue and Heat; <hi>Ripl.

                  <p>We, <hi>ſaith Eſpanietus,</hi> to deal plainly and truly; affirm, that the whole work may be perfected by two Bodies only, that is, <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> rightly prepared: For this is that Generation which is performed by Nature with the help of Art, in which the coition of Male or Female is requir'd, and from whence the Off-ſpring more noble than its Parents, is expected; <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. <hi>Arcan. Herm. Sol</hi> is the Male, for he yields the active and informing ſeed: <hi>Luna</hi> is the Female; which is called the Matrix and Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Nature, becauſe ſhe receives the ſeed of the Male into her womb, and nouriſheth it with her Menſtruum, <hi>Sect.</hi> 22. <hi>Arcan. Herm.

                     <hi>Now here we in this Book intend to treat of this Feminine Seed, or diſſolving Waters of the</hi> Adepts. <hi>Great indeed, yea vaſt is the Treaſure of our Chymy; but altogether inacceſſible by thoſe that have not the Keys thereof; without which the</hi> Adepts <hi>themſelves could neither diſſolve nor coagulate Bodies.</hi> If you know not the way of diſſolving our Body, it is in vain to operate, <hi>is the Advice of Dionyſius Zacharias, pag.</hi> 798. <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>Th.

Coral, though never ſo finely pulverized, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be mixed with the pureſt Powder of Pearls: Yea Gold mixeth not with Silver (much leſs with Bodies leſs perfect) though both be melted together; the Particles of each do indeed touch one another in their extream parts, being in a maſs or heap conſiſting of things heterogeneous, yet they are and do remain all diſtinct, unblemiſhed and unaltered in their Figures and Properties, no otherwiſe than as a heap compoſed of Barley and Oats: But in the more ſecret Chymy there is no Body, no heterogeneity, but what hath its own peculiar Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum, and with which as being homogeneous to it, it runs into one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, rejoycing in the inſeparable Properties of either. So long therefore as you intend to joyn Metals with Metals, dry things with dry, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Menſtruums of</hi> Diana, <hi>ſo long (to uſe the Phraſe of</hi> Eſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nietus) <hi>do you preſume to joyn males together, which is a thing wicked and contrary to Nature.

Wherefore I think it enough to declare to you in ſhort, that theſe</hi> Menſtruums, <hi>which hitherto you have with ſo much ſtudy, to little purpoſe ſought in the Theoretical Books of</hi> Adepts, <hi>are now offered to you, being found by me, in Practical Books, no longer ſhrowded with Obſcurity, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robed, and expoſed naked to the ſight and underſtanding of all men: But you have no cauſe to fear the Spirit of Philoſophical Wine which you perceive in any</hi> Menſtruum, <hi>it being familiar and moſt gentle, becauſe Philoſophical. Nor have you need of many Conjurations, to make it appear to you; for in all Pages of the Theoretical Books of</hi> Adepts, <hi>it offers it ſelf willingly and expects you, provided you pray to God, that he would graciouſly vouchſafe to open your Eyes; for without his permiſſion or ſpecial appointment, it dares not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it ſelf to you.

By the</hi> Menſtruums <hi>of the</hi> Adepts, <hi>we intend not all manner of Diſſolvents, prepared without the Spirit of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Wine, and only corroding, but not in the leaſt altering the more minute Particles of Bodies: Nor do we underſtand an immortal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, not permanent with things diſſolved in it: But by</hi> Menſtruum <hi>we mean a volatile Liquor made ſeveral ways of the Spirit of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Wine and divers things, not only ſeparating Bodies, but alſo continuing with them, and altering them with the addition of it ſelf, ſo as to be no more two, nor again, what they were before. For out of this Diſſolution (the ſolemn Wedlock, inſeparable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Combination of Body and Menſtruum) emergeth a new Being, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the unblemiſhed Properties of the thing diſſolved, and the thing diſſolving, not at all ſeparable by Art or Nature.</hi>

On the contrary, a</hi> Menſtruum <hi>becomes Mineral, ſo ſoon as manifeſt acidity is mixed either with the Spirit of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Wine, or a Vegetable Menſtruum; for by adding the acidity, it now diſſolves Bodies with violence and efferveſcence. I have ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided both kinds into Simple and Compound, but not as if the Simple conſiſted of fewer Ingredients, but becauſe they are of more ſimple or leſs virtue.

But I tell you it is enough to rectifie it three times, and ſtop it cloſe, that the burning Spirit may not exhale, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe herein have many men erred, thinking it ought to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times rectified, But my Son, it is an infallible ſign to you when you ſhall have ſeen that Sugar ſteeped in it, and being put to the flame burneth away as <hi>Aqua ardens.</hi> Now having the water thus prepared, you have the matter out of which the Quinteſſence is to be made, which is one principal thing we intend to treat of in this Book. Take therefore that, and put it in a circulating Veſſel, or in a Pelican, which is called the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of <hi>Hermes,</hi> and ſtop the hole very cloſe with <hi>Olibanum</hi> or <hi>Maſtick</hi> being ſoft, or quick Lime mixed with the White of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59727:27"/> Eggs, and put it in Dung, which is naturally moſt hot, or the remainings of a Wine-Preſs, in which no heat muſt be by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident diminiſhed, which you may do, my Son, if you put a great quantity of which you pleaſe of thoſe things at a corner of the Houſe, which quantity muſt be about thirty Load: This ought to be, that the Veſſel may not want heat, becauſe ſhould heat be wanting, the circulation of the water would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and that which we ſeek for uneffected; but if a continual heat be adminiſtred to it by continual circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, our Quinteſſence will be ſeparated in the colour of Heaven, which may be ſeen by a diametrical Line, which divides the upper part, that is the Quinteſſence, from the lower, namely, from the Faeces, which are of a muddy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Circulation being continued many days together in a circulating Veſſel, or in the Veſſel of <hi>Hermes,</hi> the Hole, which you ſtopp'd with the ſaid Matter, muſt be opened, and if a wonderful Scent go out, ſo as that no fragrancy of the world can be compared to it; inſomuch as putting the Veſſel to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Houſe, it can by an inviſible Miracle draw all that paſs in, to it; or the Veſſel being put upon a Tower, draws all Birds within the reach of its Scent, ſo as to cauſe them to ſtand about it.

But this Quinteſſence thus glorified, will not have that Scent, except a Body be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in it, nor have that heat in your mouth as <hi>Aqua ardens:</hi> This is indeed by the Philoſophers call'd the Key of the whole Art of Philoſophy, and as well Heaven, as our Quinteſſence, which arrives to ſo great a ſublimity, that either with it by it ſelf alone, or with the earthly Stars <hi>(Metals)</hi> the Operator of this work may do miracles upon the Earth.</p>

                        <hi>THE twenty four following Kinds of</hi> Menſtruums <hi>will prove, that amongſt the</hi> Diſſolvents <hi>of the</hi> Adepts, <hi>no one is made without the</hi> Vegetable Mercury, <hi>or Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine; <hi>for it is the foundation, beginning and end of them all: Yea it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the various and diſtinct degrees of its ſtrength, ſometimes the leaſt, ſometimes the greateſt of all the</hi> Menſtruums. <hi>It is the leaſt and weakeſt, when it doth by its ſimple <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctuoſity diſſolve only the unctuous or oyly parts of Vegetables, but either reject or leave untouched the Remainder being leſs oyly and heterogeneous to it ſelf: it becomes the ſtrongeſt when we temper its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctuoſity with Arids, (that is, dry things, not Oyly) for ſo it is made homogeneous to things dry-oyly, and to things meerly dry. In reſpect of which Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneity, the Menſtruums of the</hi> Adepts <hi>differ from the common, becauſe they do by reaſon of the ſaid Homogeneity, remain with the things diſſolved inſeparably; yea, are augmented by them, but not with the leaſt ſaturation, tranſmuted and melted into a third ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſo cannot part without the diminution or deſtruction of their former Virtues. The permanent Homogeneity of Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums with things to be diſſolved, is the reaſon why Eſſences are made with ſimple Vegetable Menſtruums, but Magiſteries with the ſame compounded, and ſo theſe operate more ſtrongly, thoſe more weakly. This is it, to comprehend all in a word, which ſhews us the various kinds of Menſtruums diſtinct one from another in ſo many ſeveral degrees, now to be deſcribed and illuſtrated by our Annotations.</hi>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59727:28"/> rectified in many Glaſs-Veſſels bought for that end: then we put one <hi>Mark</hi> of our Gold, being before calcin'd a whole month, and four <hi>Marks</hi> of <hi>Aqua vitoe</hi> into two Glaſs-Veſſels, one Retort entring into the other, being ſealed, and both placed in two great round Furnaces: we bought alſo Coals to the value of thirty Crowns at one time, to continue Fire under it for the ſpace indeed of a whole Year. We might have kept Fire for ever before any congelation would have been made in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Veſſels, as the Receipt promiſed, no ſolution pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding; for we did not operate upon a due matter, nor was that the true water of Solution, which ought to diſſolve our Gold, as appeared by experience, <hi>pag.</hi> 783. <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>Th.

                     <p>REpute me not a Liar, in calling <hi>Aqua ardens</hi> a Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and ſaying that none of the modern Philoſophers and Phyſicians have attained to it, <hi>Aqua ardens</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly found every where; for I ſpoke true of a certain: for the Magiſtery of a Quinteſſence is a thing occult, and I have not ſeen above one, and him a moſt approved Divine, that underſtood any thing of the Secret and Magiſtery of it: And I affirm for a truth, that the Quinteſſence is <hi>Aqua ardens,</hi> and is <hi>Aqua ardens.</hi> And may the God of Heaven put prudence in the heart of Evangelical Men, for whom I compoſe this Book, not to communicate this Venerable Secret of God to the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates: Behold now I open the Truth to you. Take not Wine too watry, nor Wine that is black, earthy, inſipid, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, pleaſant, ſavoury, and odoriferous Wine, the beſt that can be found, and diſtill it through cooling pipes ſo oft, till you have made the beſt <hi>Aqua ardens</hi> you can; that is, you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill it from three to ſeven times; and this is the <hi>Aqua ardens</hi> which the modern Phyſicians have not acquired. This water is the Matter out of which the Quinteſſence which we intend principally in this Book, is extracted: becauſe when you have your noble water, you muſt cauſe ſuch a Deſtillatory to be made in a Glaſs-makers Furnace, all entire of one piece, with one only hole above, by which the water muſt be put in and drawn out; for then you ſhall ſee the Inſtrument ſo compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly formed, that, that which by the virtue of Fire aſcends, and is diſtilled into the Veſſel through the Pipes, may be again car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried back, in order to aſcend again, and again deſcend continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally day and night, till the <hi>Aqua ardens</hi> be by the will of God above, converted into a Quinteſſence; and the underſtanding of the Operation is in this; becauſe the beſt <hi>Aqua ardens</hi> that can be made, hath yet a material mixture of the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; therefore it is by God ordained, that the Quinteſſence which we ſeek for, ſhould be by continual Aſcenſions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſions
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59727:31"/> ſeparated from the corruptible compoſition of the four Elements; and this is done, becauſe that which is a ſecond time or oftner ſublimed, is more pure and glorified, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the corruption of the four Elements, than when it aſcends only one time, and ſo to a thouſand times, and that which is by continual aſcent and deſcent ſublimed, comes at length to ſo great an altitude of Glorification, as to be almoſt an incorruptible Compound, as Heaven it ſelf, and of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Heaven; it is therefore called Quinteſſence, becauſe it is in reference to our Body as the Heavens in reſpect to the whole World; almoſt after the ſame manner, ſo far as Art can imitate Nature, in a near and connatural ſimilitude.</p>
                     <p>Circular Diſtillation therefore being for many days made in a Veſſel of Circulation, you muſt open the hole which is in the head of the Veſſel, which is indeed ſuppos'd to have been ſeal'd with a Seal made of <hi>Lutum Sapientioe,</hi> compounded of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Flower and the White of an Egg, and of wet Paper moſt carefully pick'd and mix'd, to prevent the leaſt exhaling. And having opened the Hole, if the Odour (which ought to be ſuper-admirable, above all the Fragrancies of the world) which ſhall ſeem to have deſcended as it were from the ſublime Throne of the moſt glorious God, be ſo great, that ſetting the Veſſel in a corner of a houſe, it ſhall by an inviſible force with the fragrancy of the Quinteſſence (which is wonderful and highly miraculous) attract to it ſelf all people that enter in; then have you the Quinteſſence which you heard of; to which none of the modern Philoſophers and Phyſicians (except him that I except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before) have ſo far as I have been able to underſtand, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. But if you find not the Odour and Influence of attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, as I ſaid, ſeal the Veſſel as before, and bring it to the heat above deſcribed, in order to compaſs your deſire by Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and Circulations; namely, in finding out this Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſo glorified, into an Odour of ineſtimable fragrancy and ſavour glorified to a wonder, and the influx of attraction before expreſſed; and not only ſo as to yield a wonderful Scent, but alſo to raiſe it ſelf more fully to a kind of incorruptibility: it hath not that heat in your mouth which <hi>Aqua ardens</hi> hath, nor that moiſtneſs, that is, ſuch an Aqueity flowing, becauſe the acute heat of the <hi>Aqua ardens;</hi> and its watery moiſtneſs is by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59727:31"/> Sublimations and Circulations wholly conſumed, and the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reity will remain apart in the bottom: And the Heaven as well as Stars, of which this our Quinteſſence is compounded both as to Matter and Form, are not as that which is compounded of the four Elements; but there is but little of it glorified ſo much even to the higheſt, fill'd with ſo noble a form, that the power of Matter cannot aſpire to any other Form, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains uncorrupted, till the Compoſition be deſtroyed by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Creator: Nor is the Quinteſſence which we ſeek, altogether reduced to the incorruption of Heaven; as neither is Art equal to Nature: yet notwithſtanding it is incorruptible in reſpect of the Compoſition made of the four Elements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhould it be altogether incorruptible, as Heaven, it would abſolutely perpetuate our Body; which the Author of Nature, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt forbids. Now have I opened to you much of the Secret, to the Glory of the immortal God.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe like Heaven it receives the Forms of all Things.</hi> As the univerſal Form <hi>(the Macrocoſmical Heaven)</hi> hath an appetite to every Form, ſo the Quinteſſence <hi>(of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Wine)</hi> to every Complexion; whereby it is evidently manifeſt, that the Quinteſſence of things is ſaid to be of that complexion to which it is adjoyned; if joyned to hot, hot; if to cold, cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This therefore the Philoſophers called Heaven; becauſe as Heaven affords us ſometimes heat, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times moiſture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo the Quinteſſence in mens Bodies at the Artiſt's pleaſure, <hi>&amp;c.

                     </p>
                     <p>We ought to ſeek that thing which is to the four Qualities of which our Body is compounded, as is Heaven in reſpect of the four Elements: Now the Philoſophers called Heaven Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in reſpect of the four Elements, becauſe Heaven is in it ſelf incorruptible and immutable, and not receiving ſtrange im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, but by the command of God; ſo alſo, the thing which we ſeek, is in reſpect of the four Qualities of our Body, a Quinteſſence, in it ſelf incorruptible ſo made, not hot dry with Fire, nor moiſt cold with Water, nor hot moiſt with Ayr, nor cold dry with Earth; but is it a Quinteſſence able to work Contraries, as the incorruptible Heaven; which, when it is neceſſary, infuſeth a moiſt Quality, ſometimes a hot, ſometimes a cold, ſometimes a dry: Such a Radix of Life is the Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which the moſt High created in Nature, with power to ſupply the neceſſity of the Body to the utmoſt term which God hath appointed to our Life: And I ſaid that the moſt High created the Quinteſſence, which is by the Art of man extracted from the Body of Nature, created by God: And I will name it by its three Names attributed to it by the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers: It is called <hi>Aqua ardens, Anima,</hi> or <hi>Spiritus Vini,</hi> and <hi>Aqua Vitoe.</hi> And when you have a mind to conceal it, call
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59727:33"/> it Quinteſſence; becauſe this is its Nature, and this is its Name, the greateſt Philoſophers have been willing to diſcloſe to no man, but cauſed the Truth to be buried with them: And that it is not moiſt as the Element of Water, is demonſtrated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it burns; which is a thing repugnant to Elementary Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. That it is not hot and moiſt as Ayr, is declared, becauſe dry Ayr may be corrupted with every thing, as appears in the generation of Spiders; but that remains always uncorrupt if it be kept from expiring. That it is not dry and cold as Earth, is expreſly manifeſt, becauſe it is exceeding ſharp, and heats extreamly: And that it is not hot and dry as Fire, is apparent to the Eye, becauſe it infrigidates hot things, and waſtes and eradicates hot Diſeaſes. That it conduceth to incorruptibility, and preſerves from corruptibility, I will demonſtrate by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment; for if any Bird whatſoever, or piece of Fleſh, or Fiſh be put into it, it will not be corrupted ſo long as it ſhall continue therein; how much more will it therefore keep the animated and living Fleſh of our Body from all corruption?

Eſſences being thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, as alſo all other Oyly things, crude or expreſſed, and all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled of both Kingdoms, Animal and Vegetable, this Spirit of Wine doth by ſimple digeſtion divide into two diſtinct parts, two Oyls or Fats, whereof one is the Eſſence of the thing, the other the Body: The Eſſence ſo made we named the</hi> Second Spirit of Wine. <hi>Both Eſſences, this by Diviſion, and that by Extraction prepared, are by longer digeſtion made one with the aforeſaid Spirit of Wine. For thoſe things which are of one and the ſame purity, and of a ſymbolical Nature, are eaſily mix'd together, and that inſeparably, and ſo an Eſſence made by an Eſſence, is joyned to that Eſſence. And if we protract Digeſtion further, one of the Fats, namely, the Body leſs Oyly, and therefore left hitherto, is at length received alſo into a ſymbolical Nature, by reaſon of which mixtion, not only is the Spirit multiplied, but alſo made fitter for the Diſſolutions of dry things, becauſe the Particles of this Body leſs Oyly incline to dryneſs; concerning which way we treat in this Receipt, in the Preſcription of which, the Oyl drawn out of Oyly Vegetables, is by diſtillation together with the Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical VVine, <hi>circulated into a Magiſtery (or double Eſſence, Natural and Artificial; of which, lower in its place) by which the Spirit of Wine is multiplied, and made more homogeneous to dry Bodies. There is the ſame</hi> Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum, <hi>but a little otherwiſe deſcribed in his Natural Magick. pag.</hi> 358. <hi>thus;</hi> Take <hi>Nigrum nigrius Nigro,</hi> and diſtil ten or eight parts of the ſame in a Glaſs-Veſſel, and in the firſt diſtillation you muſt receive only one half; this again diſtil, and hereof take a fourth part; and the third diſtillation you muſt take in a manner all, and ſo diſtil that part eight or nine times, and it will be perfect, but not rectified under one and twenty Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. Take of this VVater a quarter of a pound, and acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the ſame by diſtilling it with the Vegetables, which are <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium Sylveſtre;</hi> and ſo of the reſt, of which was ſpoken above in <hi>Anima Tranſmutationis, in the Chapter which begins, Firſt you muſt know,</hi> &amp;c. And then put it into a Veſſel of Circulation in

                     <p>Pariſinus, <hi>a Diſciple of</hi> Lully, <hi>will correct</hi> Sendivogius, <hi>who learnt of</hi> Lully <hi>to rectifie his Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine <hi>after this manner.</hi>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59727:36"/> third, two parts of three; and in the fourth, take four parts of five, and more: Then take that laſt Celeſtial Water, and diſtil it three or four times by the Rule aboveſaid, taking the whole without any ſeparation appointed. This obſerve, and admire the neceſſity of this Myſtery and Foundation, and you will underſtand the reaſon why dull and ignorant men make the worſt Bread with the fineſt and pureſt Flower, becauſe they mix the courſe part with the fine: The ſame thing happens to preſumptuous Artiſts, who perſwade themſelves that they are able to find out the beauty of our Quinteſſence with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uberated Spirit negligently purified, without an exact ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pure from the impure. <hi>in Elucid. pag.</hi> 230. <hi>Vol.</hi> 6. <hi>Theatri Chym.</hi>

                        <hi>Which way notwithſtanding of rectification ſo exactly to obſerve, there ſeems to me to be no neceſſity; rectification of the Spirit being good enough, which way ſoever done, either with fewer or more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hobations, provided it be ſeparated from the impurities of the Wine,</hi> which you will know <hi>(ſaith Lully)</hi> when it burns a piece of Linnen by reaſon of its vehement heat, <hi>that is, as elſewhere more clearly, till a Linnen Cloth moiſtned with this Spirit, and kindled, be wholly conſumed. This rectified Spirit is in diſtilling, ſharpned with the oyly Vegetables nominated in the Receipt, the Oyls of which, being neareſt to it, it eaſily carrieth with it, and is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with the ſame, and acuated by the aridity contained in them: Yet are we not obliged to uſe theſe Vegetables only, and no other, or is it neceſſary to mix all of them together, as if one or two would not ſuffice. The Oyl of any Vegetable, or drawn out of a Vegetable with the help of the Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine, <hi>or already made, and added to the Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine, <hi>will here ſatisfie us.

But that which begets the greater ſcruple, is the Paraphraſe of</hi> Lully <hi>himſelf upon this place.</hi> We, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> would not have you ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of that you may extract our <hi>Argent vive (Veget.)</hi> from its Myne another way: The way (my Son) is to take the Herb which is called <hi>Portulaca marina, Apium, Squilla,</hi> &amp;c. diſtil the Faeces which remain calcine, draw off the Salt with the diſtilled water, and abſtract the water from it, purifie the Salt by often diſſolving and coagulating, and you will have the Salt of the acuating Vegetable Herbs: Theſe <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> I meant, when I ſaid, acuate with acuating Vegetables, that is, the Salts, not the ſimple Herbs: <hi>Wherefore you might ſay, it follows, that this Receipt of the Metallick Soul hath not at all been deſcribed, ſo as to be underſtood according to the Literal Senſe; but I have my Anſwer ready, namely, that</hi> Lully <hi>acuated the Spirit of Wine with crude Vegetables alſo, it is eaſily proved by the third Diſtinction of his Book of Eſſence, in</hi> Figura individuorum, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by him, where he rehearſeth the neareſt Individuals, acua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine, <hi>as are</hi> red Wine, new Honey, Celandine, Flowers of Roſemary, Herb Mercury, red Lilly, Tartar, Mans Blood, and white Wine. <hi>Why he choſe theſe, not others, and theſe only, it is not my buſineſs to anſwer: that which we learn from thence, is, that he commended two of thoſe Individuals to us before the reſt,</hi> Tartar <hi>and</hi> Honey, <hi>of which thus.</hi> There are ſome Individuals, in which Mercury <hi>(Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)</hi> hath a free Act in ſome reſpect, in <hi>Tartar</hi> it hath one free operation only, and in <hi>Honey</hi> two, and this an Artiſt ought to know, that he may be certified in this Art, and the firſt Truth thereof. <hi>He prefers</hi> Tartar, <hi>not for the ſake of the</hi> Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, <hi>but the</hi> Alkali <hi>made from thence, and that he reſolves as the beſt of</hi> Alkalies per deliquium, <hi>and circulates it being purified
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59727:38"/> with the Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine, <hi>according to the Doctrine preſcribed</hi> in prima Tabula individuorum, <hi>in the</hi> ſecond Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, <hi>and in other places. The</hi> Alkali of Tartar <hi>may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the</hi> Alkalies of Honey, Celandine, <hi>and the reſt of the Individuals named by</hi> Lully, <hi>with which the</hi> Adepts <hi>did alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times acuate their Spirit of Wine, as ſhall be declared below in tht Fifth Kind of</hi> Menſtruums: <hi>But theſe things make alſo againſt the Literal ſenſe of our Receipt, and do prove that the Salts of the</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, <hi>not the crude</hi> Vegetables <hi>themſelves were taken in the Receipt. But though he made choice of</hi> Tartar, <hi>becauſe of the ſtrongeſt</hi> Alkali <hi>to be from thence prepared, yet did he not for the ſame reaſon intimate, that Celandine, the Flowers of Roſemary, Herb Mercury, red Lilly, and mans Blood were better than the reſt, becauſe with theſe he proceeds another way; for he ſeparates the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements from them with the Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine, <hi>from which he takes only the Fire or Oyl, which he circulates with the Spirit, and ſo acuates it, as is clearly enough evident</hi> in ſecunda Tabula Individuorum.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But becauſe</hi> Honey <hi>ſurpaſſeth not only its own collateral Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, but alſo the</hi> Tartar <hi>it ſelf (for he ſaith that the Spirit of Wine in</hi> Tartar <hi>hath one, but in</hi> Honey <hi>two free Operations) and therefore attributes his peculiar proceſs to</hi> Honey, <hi>namely, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling the whole Comb, the</hi> Honey <hi>together with the Wax, with the Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine <hi>through an Alembick. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both proceſſes of</hi> Honey, <hi>and the reſt of the Individuals our Receipt keeps a middle ſtation. If</hi> Honey <hi>be volatilized as to the whole ſubſtance, it becomes thereby a Magiſtery, which being joyn'd to the Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine, <hi>yields us a</hi> Menſtruum <hi>of the Third kind. But the Fires or Oyls of Celandine, of the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Roſemary, common white and red Wine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are by ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Elements made with the Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine, <hi>Eſſences, which being added to the ſaid Spirit of Wine, do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but multiply it rather, becauſe an Eſſence is added to an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, that is, the ſecond to the firſt Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine. <hi>But if Celandine, the Flowers of Roſemary, as alſo the Vegetables of our Receipt be diſtilled with the Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine, <hi>it does extract and elevate all their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctuoſity with it ſelf, reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the aridity of them, being more ſimple, ſubtil, volatile, and leſs loaded with dry Particles, than the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctuoſity of crude Honey;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59727:39"/> and ſo by being circulated with the Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine; <hi>it is made indeed a Magiſtery, yet more inclining to the nature of an Eſſence, and therefore leſs dry, and leſs altering the Spirit of Wine, than that of</hi> Honey, <hi>and ſo being now deſervedly united with the aforeſaid Spirit, it makes a</hi> Menſtruum <hi>different from the</hi> Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums <hi>of the Third Kind. So the Literal Senſe of our Receipt does hitherto ſtand unmoved. But not to derogate from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Author, and his own Commentator</hi> Lully, <hi>it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſuppoſe, that, the Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine <hi>being diſtilled upon the aforeſaid Vegetables, he did ſometimes out of the remainder prepare an</hi> Alkali <hi>by calcination, and acuate his Spirit with it, and ſo make a</hi> Menſtruum <hi>of the Fifth Kind.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From theſe and the like Receipts, we obſerve,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That</hi> Wine, Lunaria, Nigrum nigrius Nigro, <hi>the Matter of the</hi> Menſtruum <hi>of Vegetable Mercury or Soul of Metals, is not</hi> Common, <hi>but</hi> Philoſophical Wine; <hi>nor that the Spirit of this Wine is the Common, but Philoſophical</hi> Aqua ardens.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>That a</hi> Menſtruum <hi>of this kind is the unctuous Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine <hi>acuated, that is, tempered with the common <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctuoſity of Vegetable Oyls. Mix, digeſt, and diſtil any common diſtilled Oyl with the Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine, <hi>and you will obtain a</hi> Menſtruum <hi>of the Second Kind much ſooner; yea, you will make the ſame in a moment, if you mix the Eſſence (Spirit) of</hi> Philoſophical VVine <hi>with the Magiſtery of an oyly Vegetable.</hi>

                        <hi>Firſt, For perfect Metal, Gold or Silver. So</hi> Arnold <hi>in Flore Florum:</hi> Philoſophers call the Soul a Ferment, becauſe as the Body of man can do nothing without its Ferment or Soul, ſo is it in the thing propounded; for Ferment is a Subſtance which converts other things into its own Nature. And you muſt know, there is no Ferment, except <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> that is, Gold and Silver appropriated to thoſe Planets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ferment therefore muſt be introduced into the Body, becauſe it is the Soul thereof. This is that which <hi>Morienus</hi> ſaid, except you cleanſe the unclean Body, and make it white, and infuſe a Soul into it, you conduce nothing to this Magiſtery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, For Metals, and other things, volatilized with a</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Menſtruum. <hi>So</hi> Lully <hi>calls Gold and Silver volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized in the preparation of his</hi> Circulatum majus, Menſtruum, <hi>or animated Spirit.</hi> Take, <hi>ſaith he, the</hi> animated Spirit of <hi>Sol,</hi> and the animated Spirit of <hi>Luna,</hi> joyn them together, &amp;c. <hi>So the Tinctures of Gold and Silver volatilized by a</hi> Menſtruum, <hi>as alſo of imperfect Metals, are by him called Souls.

This I would have you certainly believe, that B hath no ſolutive Nature actually, but only potentially; for if B were not acuated by the way and means manifeſted to you, it would have no power of Diſſolving: Some made it acute with Vitriol, which way is good enough: Some with Niter: Some with Cinnabar: Some with theſe two, and ſome with all three: Some with their Earth, which way diſpleaſeth me, becauſe this way thick Unctuoſity and Pondero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity was introduced: Some have uſed Vegetables, as Herbs, Roots, Flowers, and Seeds known to you, which have powerful Mercuries in them; for this Reaſon it is, That they which handled it this way, augmented rather its Vegetable Form, than made it ſolutive: Some uſed Flowers United for acuition, which is the Principal Way, and of our Intention, which is found in the <hi>Alphabetum apertoriale:</hi> Some not knowing the true way of acuating this B, ſpent much time in preparing divers Waters, before they could put any Body into B, as happened to us in the beginning, ſeeking that Practice, which is now manifeſted to you by the Practice of our <hi>Summetta,</hi> which though it hath ſucceeded well, yet with very great Labour. The Myſtery of this diſſolutive part is difficult, and tedious, and therefore I will undertake the Repetition of it; for having made B acute by this Method, which we now manifeſt concerning the ſolution of Bodies, to be perfected without trouble in a little time, you will be certain. But I confeſs, when I was with you at that time,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59727:43"/> wherein we made the firſt beginning of diſſolving, we did not underſtand <hi>Raymund Lully</hi> in this diſſolutive part; but having read him over again returning to our Studies, Practiſing, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Faſting, a perfect Illumination of Mind came to us: this way therefore will I manifeſt under the Seal of Silence, <hi>pag.</hi> 231. <hi>Vol.</hi> 6. <hi>Theat.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59727:46"/> from all Phlegm, that, when the work is done, no Matter may remain with the Salt, but be wholly converted, which will be better and more uſeful, and by this means you will have the Animal and Vegetable Salt, which we will call Coagulative and Gelative Sulphur, becauſe it hath the property and virtue of diſſolving the two Luminaries, and reducing them from power to act, their Vegetative and Germinative Form being preſerved. Lully <hi>ſometimes ſublimed this Offa or Pap of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, in the Ninth Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment following, thus:</hi>

                     <p>There is, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> beſides, another way of Copulating the aforeſaid Animal Spirit with the Vegetable Spirit, namely, thus: Take of the Animated Spirit, rectifi'd as above, what quantity you will, and pour it upon three parts of our <hi>(Philoſophical) A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua Vitoe</hi> perfectly rectifi'd, which Copulation ought to be made in a Body large and high, to which an Alembick may be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly fitted: the ſaid Copulation therefore being made, you muſt have preſently ready ſome Cotton-Wooll dipped in Oyl, and very well ſqueezed, wherewith the Mouth of the Diſtilling Veſſel muſt be forthwith ſtopped, and it muſt be let in within the Neck downward, a hands breath, faſtened with a ſtrong Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel thread, that upon occaſion you may draw out the ſaid Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Wooll, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59727:47"/> and keep it; for it is of very great Virtue and Efficacy.

                     </p>
                     <p>Though therefore it be uncertain to Divine what Spirit of Wine out of ſuch a vaſt number of <hi>Menſtruums Triſmoſinus</hi> intended; yet ſhall we not much err from the Truth, if we take any <hi>Menſtruum</hi> whatſoever, eith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But I ſaid, Synonima's in the Writings of the ſame, not of another <hi>Adept,</hi> becauſe oftentimes others intended another thing by theſe Names, yea that Name which hath in one Book the ſame ſignification with the reſt, hath commonly in another, though of the ſame Author, a ſignification different from them; and therefore that Synonymum muſt, if poſſible, be had out of the ſame Book, which muſt then be compared both with other Writings of the ſame Author, and alſo with the Writings of other <hi>Adepts,</hi> to confirm the meaning of the Author about the identity of the Synonimum, which was doubted of.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2.</hi> But if there be no Synonima's in Books of the ſame Author, it is not convenient for this unknown Name to be explicated by the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of other <hi>Adepts,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Adepts</hi> themſelves have ſometimes
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59727:48"/> alſo erred, in giving an explication either better than was fitting, or altogether contrary, to an obſcure Name and Place; yet is it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lawful, but neceſſary alſo, to obſerve what they ſay, eſpecially the Scholars or Followers of the ſame Author; for though they ſhew not the Authors Meaning, yet do they their own as to that Matter.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>3.</hi> But if Synonima's cannot diſcover the Name, ſome expreſſion uſed in the Receipt will perhaps explain more eaſily, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it be rightly examined by an induſtrious Obſerver of thoſe Receipts; as,</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1.</hi> If it be not known, whether the <hi>Adept</hi> means a Mineral (Acid) or Vegetable <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> it muſt be enquired by the Particulars following:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether that <hi>Menſtruum</hi> diſſolves Bodies with force or heat, for then it muſt be Mineral, this Sign betraying the acidity of Minerals Salts: becauſe Vegetable <hi>Menſtruums</hi> diſſolve Bodies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſweetly, and ſlowly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the diſſolution digeſted for a time be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a Black Colour, or Black Powder ſwimming upon the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum,</hi> for that ſignifies a Vegetable <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> becauſe the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of Mineral <hi>Menſtruums</hi> do contain Bodies twice diſſolved, once with the Spirit of <hi>Philoſophical Wine,</hi> wherewith they become Black, then with the corroſive or acid Spirit of Salts: Therefore the Black Powder and Colour are Signs of a Vegetable diſſolution, whereto is added a Milky Opacity, common indeed to both <hi>Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums,</hi> for all weak or weakened <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> containing as it were their aridity leſs diſſolved and precipitated, as alſo Vegetable diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions longer digeſted after blackneſs, do become Opacous and Milky, and ſo continue, till they are made diaphanous and moſt clear, by drawing of the Phlegm, the acid part, or the Spirit of <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Wine</hi> being better concentrated: yet theſe three Signs we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obſerve in the uſe of the Mineral <hi>Menſtruums.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether the <hi>Adepts</hi> admoniſh the Operator to beware of air or fume in Operation, or Poyſon in the uſe of the thing already prepared; for that is a Sign that his <hi>Menſtruum</hi> is, or was Mineral, becauſe Poyſons derive themſelves Originally from acidity, for Pearls and Corals, yea Gold and all other Arids, though otherwiſe moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; do, by being prepared with a Mineral <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> become the worſt of Poyſons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If you ſee Mineral Bodies diſtinguiſhed into two Oyls, ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59727:48"/> diſtinctly and ſeverally upon the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> ſay, that alſo was a Mineral <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> becauſe this cannot be done by any Vegetable <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> though never ſo ſtrong.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2.</hi> If it be not known, whether either the ſimple or compounded Vegetable <hi>Menſtruum</hi> is to be taken, we obſerve the things follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to the uſe of them:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> If in the diſſolution of a Metallick or Mineral Body, a White Body or ſome reſidue be left, then may ye know it to be a ſimple Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> becauſe it extracts only the Tinctures or Eſſences of things, diſſolving the Oleoſity, but not the Aridity of things, on the contrary Vegetable <hi>Menſtruums</hi> compounded, as alſo Mineral <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums,</hi> which are ſtronger than the Simple, do diſſolve the whole Body, not leaving any Foeces.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the whole Body of a thing diſſolved be turned into Oyl, ſwimming upon the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> that was a Vegetable <hi>Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> compounded, for that only are they able to do: The ſimple Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Menſtruums</hi> are not ſtrong enough, but Mineral <hi>Menſtruums</hi> are too ſtrong; thoſe therefore diſſolve not the whole Body, but theſe diſſolve not only the whole Body, but reduce it, being diſſolved into Oyl, not one only, but twofold: So the <hi>Temperatum</hi> of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> (a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> otherwiſe ſufficiently unknown) is by uſe known, to be the <hi>Circulatum majus,</hi> or a Vegetable <hi>Menſtruum</hi> compounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he reduceth Metals by it into a ſwimming Oyl, or Magiſtery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If in the diſſolution or digeſtion of the thing diſſolved, you ſee it made Black, or caſt forth a Black Powder, ſay it is was a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Vegetable <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> becauſe Vegetable <hi>Menſtruums</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and Mineral, as being ſtronger, do better retain their Body diſſolved in them.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>3.</hi> But the doubt, whether the ſimple Vegetable <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> or Spirit of <hi>Philoſophical Wine</hi> is to be taken, length of time alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth; for the ſooner Eſſences are made in the Mineral Kingdom, the ſtronger are the <hi>Menſtruums;</hi> and on the contrary: But in the Animal and Vegetable Kingdoms it is difficult, if not altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, to diſcern by the length of time alone the diſſolutions of the Bodies as being more opened; of which ſort are Oyls, Salts, as alſo the open Metal Mercury, eſpecially ſublimed, being more amply opened by the acidity of Salts.</p>

But now, moſt dear Son, you muſt proceed to the compoſition of our <hi>Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> the Powers and Virtues whereof are ſo many and ſo great, as ſcarce to be comprehended within the expreſſion of Man. The
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59727:51"/> way of which operation is thus: You muſt know the weight of the Salt or Oyl, which you beheld in the bottom of the Veſſel depurated, and pour to it ſo much of our Spirit (that is <hi>Aqua Vitoe</hi> rectify'd ſo, as to burn a Cloth ſteeped in it) as will be four Fingers above it, or let there be ſix parts more of the weight of the <hi>Aqua Vitoe,</hi> than is the Salt or Oyl: the whole being mix'd together, put into an Urinal with a Cover or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenotorium</hi> well luted, that it reſpire not: putrifie in Balneo the ſpace of two Natural Days, then take off the <hi>Antenotorium,</hi> and put on an Alembick, with a Receiver, cloſe the Joynts well, and diſtil in a Furnace of Aſhes with a ſlow Fire: which diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation muſt be continued till the Beak or Head diſcover no Veins, but ſuddenly after the Veins diſappear, lay aſide the Receiver with the diſtilled Water (<hi>Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine) and ſtop it cloſe, for now comes the animated Spirit (<hi>Spirit of Wine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with the Eſſence of</hi> Tartar) which hath the power of vivifying its Body (or <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi>) then continue the ſame diſtillation, in the end augmenting the Fire, that if any part of Phlegm remain, it may exhale and be removed by that degree of heat: Laſtly, the Veſſel being cold, take out the matter and grind it: know the weight of the matter, and pour to it four parts of <hi>Aqua Vitoe</hi> more than is the Earth <hi>(Caput mortuum)</hi> and covering the Veſſel cloſe with its <hi>Antenotorium,</hi> putrifie as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then putting an Alembick to it with a Receiver, well lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, diſtill as before, in a Furnace of Aſhes: the Soul being with its Spirit gone over, with the ſame Signs of Veins, as before, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, repeat the ſame Magiſtery three times: For then will you have the Spirit perfectly animated, and the Body exanima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and calcined: This Spirit with the Soul <hi>(of Tartar)</hi> is indeed capable of diſpoſing every Phyſical operation, but in this place we will uſe it for the vivifying of the calcined Earth: Take therefore the aforeſaid Earth out of its Veſſel, and grind it, then put a little of it upon a red hot plate, which if it melt like Wax without fume, is a ſign of perfect exanimation; if this ſign ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear not, this Magiſtery muſt be reiterated, till you have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſign. Then know the weight of the Earth, upon which pour a fourth part of the animated Spirit, and the Veſſel being covered cloſe with its <hi>Antenotorium,</hi> ſet it in Balneo two or three days to be congealed, or till it be congealed; which done, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move

Take therefore the aforeſaid pregnant Earth, and put it into a Bolt-head <hi>(Sublimatory)</hi> with a long Neck, which you muſt lute very well with <hi>Lutum Sapientioe,</hi> and the luting being dryed, ſet it with the matter into a diſtilling Furnace, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring in the beginning a gentle Fire, till the Bolt-head grow hot, whoſe Mouth muſt be ſtopped with Cotton-wooll, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue that gentle heat the ſpace of ſix Hours, then augment the Fire ſomewhat ſix Hours more; but if it begins not by that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Fire to ſublime, increaſe the Fire gradually to a more violent degree, till it begin to ſublime, which Fire continue the ſpace of twenty four Hours, at the expiration of which time, the Veſſel being cold, take from thence our Sulphur ſublimed <hi>(the Vegetable Sulphur of Nature)</hi> our Mercury <hi>(Vegetable)</hi> our Heaven <hi>(dry)</hi> our <hi>Sal Armoniack (Vegetable)</hi> our Stone not yet fermented, and call'd by many more other Names, whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is to acuate its Spirit (<hi>of</hi> Philoſophical Wine) as ſhall be made appear by the Experiments hereafter following:</p>

                           <hi>This Volatilization of the Salt of</hi> Tartar <hi>is ſufficiently tedious, yet eaſie and clear, according to the tenour of the Receipt.

Take notice, if this Spirit of <hi>Calx</hi> be not rightly prepared or impregnated with the like Spirit of Wine, by the aforeſaid cohobations, it is in diſtilling mixed with its Phlegm, extinguiſhed, and loſeth its Virtue; ſo difficult a thing it is to drive deeply into Nature, ſhe reſerving many things to her ſelf: This Spirit being now mix'd with the Spirit of Wine, take away the Receiver, pour out the Phlegm, and keep the Spirits of the <hi>Calx</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> wearily: Obſerve, both theſe Spirits are ſeparated not without difficulty, for they embrace one another, and in diſtillation aſcend together: Wherefore, if you kindle the Spirits being mix'd and united in a Glaſs Veſſel, the Spirit of <hi>Wine</hi> is burned, but the Spirit of the <hi>Calx</hi> remains in the Glaſs, which keep diligently: This is a great <hi>Arcanum,</hi> few Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits do exceed its efficacy, if you knew the uſe of it, its quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can ſcarce be deſcribed by way of <hi>Compendium.</hi> This Spirit diſſolves Crabs Eyes, andthe hardeſt Criſtals: theſe three diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together through an Alembick, and many times cohobated, make a Liquor, three drops of which taken in warm Wine, do break and diſſolve the Gravel and Stone in Mans Body, this Liquor expells the very root or cauſe of that Diſeaſe without any pain to the Patient: This Spirit of <hi>Calx</hi> at the beginning is of a Sky-Colour, but being gently rectified appears white, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent and clear, leaving ſome few Faeces behind it: This Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit diſſolves the moſt fixed Jewels, and Precious Stones, and on the contrary fixeth all Volatile Spirits by its tranſcendent heat: This Spirit overcomes all Symptoms whatſoever of the <hi>Poda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra,</hi> though never ſo knotty and tartarous, all which it diſſolves and radically expells.</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59727:58"/> will you have a moſt Precious Salt, or Vegetable Mercury: Which done, know the weight of the ſaid Congelation or Salt, and pour to it a third part of the Water, which you kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and which you rectify'd ſeven times in Aſhes, <hi>(the acid Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Honey)</hi> and ſtop the Veſſel with its <hi>Antenotorium,</hi> and ſet it in Balneo five Days, then having taken away the <hi>Antenotori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and put on an Alembick, you muſt with a temperate Fire by diſtillation exhale all the moiſture that will diſtil, and that will be inſipid, for the Earth hath received, and in it ſelf retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Virtue and Acetoſity of the Water: Then again imbibe the Earth with new Water as before, and repeat the Magiſtery by imbibing, digeſting, and diſtilling ſo oft as before, till the Earth hath attracted and imbibed all its Water: And ſo by the help of the living God will you truly have the Vegetable Salt drawn from this individual, which Salt is moſt precious, and hath the power of acuating the Vegetable Mercury, and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the two Luminaries, and all the other imperfect Metals: And with this may Metals be reduced into their firſt Matter.</p>

Now take the aforeſaid Body, firſt weigh it, then put it in a convenient Veſſel, and pour to it an eighth part of its Spirit <hi>(animated Spirit)</hi>
                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:59727:63"/> which extracted its Soul, then put your Veſſel in a Fire of dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, (which we ſhall ſpeak of afterwards) and continue the Fire till you ſee that the Earth hath imbibed its Liquor: then open your Veſſel, put on an Alembick, and gather that little ſweat, which will have the taſte of hot Water: Imbibe now your Matter for a ſecond time with a ſeventh part of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Spirit, which contains the Soul, and proceed in the metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing of the aforeſaid Magiſtery: Now for a third time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe with a ſixt part, for a fourth time imbibe with a fifth part, for a fifth time imbibe with a fourth part, and do not multiply the weight of the aforeſaid Spirit, but continue it ſo, obſerving the aforeſaid Method, till the Matter, which hath drunk up its Spirit, and is again united with its Soul, be white. Take now the aforeſaid Earth, and put it in convenient ſublimation, the lower part of the Veſſel being luted below the Matter, and make the pure part ſublime from the impure, and ſo will you have our Mercury, which is clear and ſhining as a Diamond. This is that which the Philoſophers do by divers Metaphors, call the firſt Vegetable Matter, <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> our Mercury, our Sulphur of Nature, whereas notwithſtanding 'tis one and the ſame thing. Take the other Simple Spirit, which you firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of your <hi>Chaos,</hi> that which hath not extracted its Soul, and make it more pure and ſubtil by the way following: Take of the Vegetable firſt Matter <hi>(Sal Armoniack)</hi> which you made before, one Pound, and put it in a convenient Veſſel in Balneo, till the Matter diſſolve it ſelf <hi>(per deliquium)</hi> then put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to an Alembick, diſtil the ſuperfluous Water, then pour on three Pounds of the aforeſaid Simple Spirit <hi>(ardens)</hi> and the Veſſel being conveniently ſtop'd, as will be manifeſted below, put it into Putrefaction for one Natural Day, after the manner following: Get you a Braſs Veſſel, about one ſpan and a half broad, and three ſpans and a half long, which towards the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice muſt have a Copper Bottom pierced with many Holes, the Cover whereof, which is to go into the Veſſel, and ſtop it well, muſt have one or two Holes: but the Glaſs Veſſels, which you would put to that Copper Veſſel, ought to be conveniently co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: in the lower part of thoſe Copper Veſſels of Putrefaction muſt be common Water, thoſe Copper Veſſels put upon a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, making a moderate Fire under, by the ſtrength of which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59727:63"/> the fume or vapour of the Water will aſcend, and heat the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, in which your Matter is; the whole work of our Supream Magiſtery will be matured and prepared by this Method, then diſtil conveniently in Aſhes with a heat, ſcarce unlike to the heat of the Sun, till you have drawn all the Juice from it, then diſſolve the Matter by pouring to it of the aforeſaid Simple Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit three parts, in reſpect of the Matter, which remained in the Veſſel, after the aforeſaid Juice was abſtracted from it; Repeat the Magiſtery a fourth time, proceeding and obſerving all things exactly as above: So will you have the Spirit of your <hi>Chaos,</hi> which is by the Philoſophers called <hi>Fire depurated,</hi> reduced from power into act with the Virtue of the Vegetable Matter. Take therefore a Glaſs Veſſel, ſtrong, able to contain the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a common Urne, pure and long, whoſe Neck muſt be ſtrong, and two ſpans and a half long, whoſe Cover muſt be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Glaſs, called <hi>Antenotorium,</hi> with a Neck turned downward, containing the fourth part of a common Urne, to be put into the aforeſaid Veſſel: Into this Circulating Veſſel put four Pounds, and no more, of the depurated Spirit, which you brought from power to action, by Virtue of the Vegetable Matter, as I taught you before Circulate in Balneo, or Dung the ſpace of ſixty Days, and when Converſion is made of the Spirit deduced from power to action by the firſt Vegetable Matter, then this you will thereby know, that in the bottom of the Veſſel will be a Sediment, like the Urine of a ſound Man: Then will you ſee a Quinteſſence brighter and clearer then a Diamond, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the Stars in ſplendour, ſo as to be doubted, whether it be contain'd in the Glaſs or not: which you muſt dexterouſly ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from its Sediment, and keep in a Veſſel cloſe ſtopped in a cold place: This is that Virtue which the envious have hidden, and obſcured by innumerable Metaphors, calling it <hi>Spiritus Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus, Aqua Argenti vivi, Aqua Vitoe, Aqua Celeſtis, Aqua Dianoe, Anima Menſtrui Vegetabilis, Fumus, Ventus,</hi> our <hi>Heaven, Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Blood, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine ſublimed, Menſtruum, our Water of Sulphur, our Bleſſed Stone,</hi> giving it infinite other Names, which we mention not here, but have by Experience ſeen and known them to be one and the ſame thing.</p>

The way, my Son, is, to diſtil the Phlegm, till it remain in the form of liquid Pitch, then put to it of the Water <hi>(ardens)</hi> which you rectify'd, ſo much, as to ſwim three Fingers above the Matter, and the Veſſel being very cloſe, ſet it in Dung or Balneo ſix Days to digeſt, after that diſtil all the Water, in which is the Soul, upon hot Aſhes, then increaſe the Fire a little, and take out the Oyl; which keep: then pour in of the other Water <hi>(ardens, or Spirit of Philoſophical Wine)</hi> as before, and put it in Putrefaction ſix Days, as before, and then diſtil in Aſhes, firſt the Water, then the Oyl, and thus continue the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtery the ſame way, till you have extracted all the Soul from the Earth, keep it, becauſe it is the animated Water, and keep the Oyl for the Tincture: Then take the Earth being dry and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59727:64"/> hardened, and calcine till it grows white, being white, give the Soul in the Water reſerved to it. My Son! the way is this, Take the Earth being white and depurated <hi>(Salt)</hi> and know the weight, put it in a Veſſel of Glaſs, and pour upon it an eighth part of the animated Water, the Veſſel being very cloſe, and place it in Balneo three days, till you ſee the ardent Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed in the Balneo, and rectify it, till it be without Phlegm, then having put on an Alembick, draw off the Liquor without taſte, becauſe the Soul hath embraced the Spirit, which is in that part; and imbibe a ſecond time with a ſeventh part of the animated Water, and digeſt as before, and diſtil away the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture: A third time imbibe with a ſixth part, digeſt and diſtil away the VVater: A fourth time pour on a fifth part of the animated VVater, as before: The fifth time give a fourth part, and digeſt as you know; and continue with the fourth part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways digeſting and drawing of the Liquor, till our Earth be pregnant and white: Then take the Earth being pregnant, and put it in a ſubliming Veſſel luted and very cloſe in a Fire of the third degree, the ſpace of twenty four Hours, and ſublime the pure from the impure: And thus my Son will you have the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable Mercury ſublimed, clear, reſplendent in the Form of a wonderful Salt. Know you muſt my Son, that the Philoſophers and we do call it properly <hi>Vegetable Sulphur, Sal Armoniack,</hi> our <hi>Sulphur,</hi> the <hi>Sulphur of Nature,</hi> and many other Names we alſo give it. Take, my Son, of this <hi>Vegetable Sulphur,</hi> which you made, one Ounce, put it in a Glaſs Veſſel, and pour upon it three Ounces of the VVater, <hi>(Aqua ardens rectifyed to the higheſt)</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to you before, and the Veſſel being covered cloſe, put it in Balneo for one Natural Day, then Diſtil in Aſhes, till all aſcend that can, then know the weight of the Salt remaining at the bottom of the Veſſel, and pour to it three times its weight of the aforeſaid <hi>Aqua ardens,</hi> and put it in our Balneo the ſpace of one natural Day, then Diſtil in Aſhes, and thus do three times: Then is all the Vegetable Salt come over the Helm with its own VVater, and mixture is made, and the Water clear, which we call <hi>Simple Menſtruum.</hi> My Son! Take a Glaſs Veſſel, which muſt be white Glaſs and ſound, and it muſt be a large Veſſel, and put into it four Pounds, or ſix (at moſt) of this <hi>Menſtruum</hi> thus ſimply diſſolved, and the Veſſel being well ſhut and ſealed,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59727:65"/> put it in Balneo or Dung, the ſpace of ſixty Days, and it will in that time be converted into a Quinteſſence exceeding Glorious and Odoriferous, which you will know, when you ſee in the bottom of the Veſſel a Sediment, like that in the Urine of a well Complexioned Youth, and it will be clear and reſplendent, as a Star of Heaven: Keep it in a hot and moiſt place, as is a Balneo, ſeparating it firſt from its Sediment, and ſealing the Veſſel well as may be.</p>

F.</hi> yet to prevent the loſs of time, ſo ſoon as you have rectify'd your ardent Spirit, otherwiſe called the firſt Flower, I had rather have you forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with put it into Practice, which we have in this <hi>Chapter ſignified by theſe two Letters, D. D.</hi> whereof one denotes the acuition of it, the other its Royal Acuator, that is, Salt extracted out of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, by the way which we have oftentimes ſhewed you, that is, with its moſt precious Water (<hi>of Honey, or the</hi> Menſtruum <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the third Kind, Numb.</hi> 10.) and though this Water be good enough, yet this Water, being acuated with its moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Salt, of which you will be more certain, will recompence your Labour, and abundantly ſuſtain you, till you attain to the end of your Labour, the great Medicine. Now to the purpoſe, Take white Honey of young Bees, put it in Putrefaction in large Cucurbits, with their Alembicks in Balneo, and make it boyl continually for an Hour, the reſt of the time let it remain in a temperate heat, and this do for the ſpace of fifteen Natural Days, then pour to the matter ſo much of C, as to ſwim the breadth of four Fingers above it, covering the Veſſels with the blind Heads, and putting them in Putrefaction three Natural Days; then put on the Alembicks with their Receivers, and the Joynts being well luted, diſtil in Balneo, and when ſeven parts of eight are diſtilled, or (which is a more certain ſign) when you ſee round tears or drops aſcend, lay aſide the Receivers cloſe ſtopp'd, that nothing may evaporate, keep them in a cool place, for the acuition of the matter; then continue the diſtillations in the ſame degree of heat, till nothing more aſcends; but if neceſſity requires a greater Fire, have a care of making it too ſtrong, and when nothing will aſcend by the ſaid Rule, take away alſo theſe Receivers, and keep them, becauſe they contain the ſecond Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Phlegm for the extraction of the moſt precious Salt:
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59727:79"/> Now put your matter in Aſhes, and diſtil with a heat of the third degree, the Oyl being diſtilled, ſuffer the matter to cool, which being pulverized, reverberate in an Earthen Diſh in a Reverberatory for eight Days, or till it be calcin'd enough; the ſign will be when you find it of an Aſh Colour: then pour of the reſerved Phlegm to it ſo much as to cover it the breadth of two Fingers; the Veſſel being covered with a blind Head, keep it in Balneo two or three Days, decant the Liquor, and pouring on new Phlegm, repeat ſo oft, till you have extracted all the Salt, which will exceed Snow in whiteneſs: And this is that Salt, wherewith we acuate our ſimple C, (<hi>the ardent Spirit for a</hi> Menſtruum <hi>of the Fifth Kind</hi>) this is that which gives the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Vegetation to both the Luminaries, reducing them into the Nature of a Quinteſſence: And with the ſame may you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo acuate, and augment its own VVater (<hi>of Honey, or</hi> Menſtruum <hi>of the Third Kind</hi>) which hath the power of Vegetating all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals. VVith this alone will you ſupport your ſelf in your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, ſo as to be in duty bound, my Son! to give thanks to the abſolute power: Be careful not to diſcloſe ſo great a ſecret to any Man; for we have now declared it ſo plainly, that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to add any thing more. Now take your decantations, which you drew off in Balneo, that the Salt may remain moſt white, which you muſt diſſolve, filtre, and congeal three times, and it will be fit for all your operations. Now let us deſcend to the practice of acuition. Take of the Salt aforeſaid one ounce, to which being well pulverized, pour four parts of C, that is, the firſt Spirit (<hi>ardent, but becauſe a</hi> Menſtruum <hi>of the fifth, and not of this Kind, would be made by this Spirit, therefore is C, being acuated with Honey, or the mellifluous Heaven of</hi> Pariſinus, <hi>a</hi> Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum <hi>of the third Kind to be taken</hi>) in a blind Head, and the Joynts well luted, putrify the ſpace of two Natural Days, then put on an Alembick with a Receiver, and diſtil in Aſhes: diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation being ended, take a pound of the Salt remaining in the Retort, and add to it four times the quantity of C, putrifying, and diſtilling in Aſhes as before, and the Magiſtery ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, till all the Salt aſcends together with its Celeſtial Spirit, or C, and by this way may you acuate and multiply as you pleaſe: but remember that one part of Salt requires four parts of C, (<hi>in this place, the Coelum mellifluum of</hi> Pariſinus.) And you
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59727:80"/> muſt know, I tell you no fabulous Stories, but very diſtinctly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to you the order of true Practice, yet with this Proviſo, That when firſt you have brought it into action, you would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together conceal it, conſidering with how great obſcurity the ancient Philoſophers delivered theirs, which notwithſtanding they had not done, but to reſtrain the ignorant from being too arrogant, for the ſame reaſon alſo do we deſire, that, as we have more than often admoniſhed you, you would keep ſecret, and in convenient time and place work for your ſelf, and the poor of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Cap. quartum ſignificatum per E.</hi> VVe ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn infinite thanks to the goodneſs of the Eternal God, in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us ſo bountifully the way of preparing our Heaven, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us partakers of ſo admirable and ineſtimable a favour. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, when I had compleated this moſt ſecret Science, and ſeen real tranſmutation the firſt time, I was in a manner aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and often lifting up my Eyes to Heaven, fell proſtrate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, giving thanks to Almighty God. Now to the purpoſe: Take a large Glaſs of ſuch a ſize, as I ſhewed you one at <hi>Murarium,</hi> into which put two or three pounds of that <hi>Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> ſtop it well, and circulate in Balneo or Horſe-Dung, but have a care leſt in changing the Dung you impede the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo let it circulate the ſpace of forty Natural Days, and then you will find your matter clear as Criſtal, with a Sediment in the bottom like Silk, which decant warily into another Glaſs, keep it very cloſe in Balneo, and you will have a Simple Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Menſtruum, (if made of the ardent Spirit, and Salt of Honey, but a compound, if prepared with the</hi> Coelum mellifluum <hi>of</hi> Pariſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus <hi>and Salt of Honey</hi>) our Heaven is in Virtue beyond expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, herewith do we truly calcine and diſſolve the Luminaries, with the preſervation of their radical moiſture. This is that which will reduce imperfect as well as perfect Metals from pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into action. And though I may ſeem not to have delineated to you the Form of the Glaſs, yet I know, and do remember, that I left ſome of them at your Houſe, and many other of our Cucurbits, which are every one good.

In <hi>Argent vive</hi> alone it is found more eaſily and more nearly, not more perfectly, it being the Father of both thoſe Luminaries, and all things fuſible, for they are all derived from it, and therefore are they all reſolv'd into it, becauſe Nature embraceth its own Nature more amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and rejoyceth with it more, than with that which is Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59727:82"/> his Hell Fire: yet principal care muſt be taken, that ſuch</hi> Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums <hi>as theſe made of Mercury ſublimate, be by being dulcify'd with longer than ordinary circulation, or repeated cohobations, freed from all the acidity of the Salts; but this operation being full of danger, yea contrary to the Rule of Vegetable</hi> Menſtruums, <hi>which excludes every Acid whatſoever, we have therefore thought good to adviſe young Beginners to uſe crude Mercury, as ſafer than ſublimate.

In this revivification therefore Mercury requires nothing, foraſmuch as common Water decocts not, nor alters it, becauſe it enters it not, and that which enters not, alters not, becauſe every thing to be alter'd muſt firſt be mixed: Some ſuperficial impurities of Mercury, ſuch Water may indeed waſh away from it, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not infuſe a new quality into it: For ſuch a Nature as Mercury had when reduced into Powder, and mortified by ſublimations, ſuch a Nature exactly will it keep being revivifyed by Water: This I am willing to ſay with Reverence and Honour to the ſaid <hi>Arnold,</hi> but I conſider and defend the Truth of Nature and Experiment. <hi>About the end of his Epiſtle to</hi> Thomas.</p>

Now mix new Matters with your ſublimation, and ſublime as before, and this repeat ſeven times; then grind the ſublimation into a moſt fine Powder, put it in the aforeſaid Cucurbit with its blind Head, or Aludel, and alſo with its common Alembick, becauſe of the operation differing from the former; the ſublimation being put into a Cucurbit, pour to it of the ſimple Animal or Vegetable <hi>Menſtruum (the Animal</hi> Menſtruum <hi>deſcribed in Numb.</hi> 37. <hi>or Vegetable in Numb.</hi> 29. <hi>but here above he order'd him to take Vegetable Water recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, that is,</hi> Aqua ardens) ſo much, as to be three Fingers above it, cover it with a blind Head, and digeſt in Aſhes twelve Hours, then taking off the blind Head, put on a common Alembick, and draw off the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> in Balneo, lay aſide the Alembick again, and put on an Aludel, ſet the Veſſel in Aſhes ſo deep, as to cover the Matter in the Glaſs, give Fire by degrees, till all the moiſture is exhaled, the Hole in the upper part of the Alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del ſtop with Cotton, increaſe the Fire, that the Mercury may be ſublimed: Sublimation being ended, and the Veſſels cold, take away the Aludel, and what you find ſublimed in it, is not for our purpoſe; for it is that aduſt part, which is no Ingredient to our Magiſtery: Then gather the ſublimation from the ſides of the Cucurbit, which will be clear as Criſtal, and have a care that it be not mix'd with its Faeces, grind, ſift, and put it into the ſame Veſſel, being cleanſed from the Faeces, and pour the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> drawn off in Balneo to it, cover the Veſſel with an Aludel, digeſt twelve Hours as before, lay aſide the Aludel, put on a common Alembick, diſtil in Balneo, lay aſide this Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick, put on an Aludel, and ſublime in Aſhes, the Faeces, as alſo the aduſtive part being caſt out of the Aludel, gather the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſubſtance out of the Cucurbit dexterouſly; with this method you muſt ſublime ſeven times, or till it leaves no Faeces in the Cucurbit: Having obtained this ſign, take the ſaid ſubſtance, grind, and put it in a Glaſs Veſſel, pour to it the ſimple either Animal or Vegetable <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> the height of three Fingers, cover the Veſſel with a blind Head, digeſt gently two Days in Aſhes, then decant the diſſolution into another Veſſel, and that which remains in the Veſſel, dry with a temperate heat, like that of the Sun, to which pour new <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> covering the Veſſel with a blind Head as before, and repeat the ſame method,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59727:102"/> till all the diſſolvible part is diſſolved, and in the bottom of the Glaſs will remain an indiſſolvible Earth, to be caſt away, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth: Now take away diſſolution, that is, your decan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and diſtil in Balneo, and the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> being diſtilled, put on an Aludel, and in Aſhes ſublime the Criſtalline ſubſtance, which may truly be called the firſt Matter of Mercury; this is that middle ſubſtance, with which we incalcinate our <hi>Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, (Circulatum majus, deſcribed in Numb.</hi> 50.) and make infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite particulars, as we have taught you before: This alſo is called the Mineral Stone. Now, my Son! will you be able to proceed by infinite ways, yet following theſe which I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you; and remember, that Mercury thus reduced, is that, which our Captain <hi>Raymond</hi> ſpeaks of, making mention of the Mineral Stone, as alſo in the <hi>laſt Chapter of his Book, nam'd</hi> Vade mecum, and in many other places of his Volumes. This is that Mercury which <hi>Arnold de Villa nova;</hi> treats of in his <hi>Roſarium,</hi> and we declare to you, except Mercury be reduced into the firſt Matter with the ſaid Vegetable or Animal Water, it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impoſſible to do any good with it, by reaſon of its great Corruption, occaſioned by the crudity of it.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond Water is thus made: Take half an Ounce of Lead, and of the aforeſaid Water as much as ſufficeth, when you ſee the Lead diſſolved, ſeparate the Water by filtred diſtillation <hi>(filtre the diſſolution of the Lead)</hi> and throw out the Faeces, as
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59727:103"/> nothing worth, then diſtil the Water by Balneo (<hi>draw off the</hi> Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum <hi>in Balneo</hi>) and keep the Faeces <hi>(the diſſolved Lead)</hi> for occaſion.</p>
                     <p>The third Water is thus made: Take of Copper one Ounce, and diſſolve it in as much of the firſt Water as you pleaſe, and let it reſt in its Veſſel, in a cold place, for a Natural Day, then ſeparate the Green Water through a Filtre, and pour out the firſt Faeces, <hi>(that which remains in the Filtre muſt be caſt away)</hi> then diſtil the Water through an Alembick, and keep the ſecond Faeces.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Water is thus made: Take one Ounce of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Tin of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> which is purer than any other, and diſſolve it in a quantity of the firſt Water, and diſtil <hi>(through a Filtre)</hi> that Water <hi>(diſſolution)</hi> with its limoſity, and the Faeces which remain caſt away, then diſtil the Water through an Alembick, and keep <hi>(the reſidue, or Tin diſſolved)</hi> the ſecond Faeces.</p>
                     <p>The fifth Water is thus made: Take of the pureſt Iron one Ounce, and diſſolve it in a ſufficient quantity of the firſt Water, then diſtil through a Filtre, and caſt away the Faeces, diſtil the Water through an Alembick, and keep the ſecond Faeces.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth Water is thus made: Take of the pureſt Gold one Ounce, and diſſolve it as I told you in my <hi>Teſtamentum,</hi> that is, with pure <hi>Lunaria (the ſimple Vegetable</hi> Menſtruum <hi>without</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent vive <hi>and Silver</hi>) mix'd with ſuch a weight of the fifth Water <hi>(now prepared from Iron)</hi> and do, as you did with the other.</p>
                     <p>You may alſo, Son! diſſolve all thoſe Metals in this order: Having made the firſt Water, in it diſſolve the Metal, which we commanded you to diſſolve after the ſecond way <hi>(to wit Lead)</hi> then do with it as we told you before. In this ſecond Water diſſolve the third Metal, <hi>(Copper)</hi> and in the Water of the third Metal diſſolve the fourth Metal, <hi>(Tin)</hi> and in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the fourth Metal diſſolve the fifth Metal <hi>(Iron)</hi> and in the Water of the fifth Metal diſſolve the ſixth Metal <hi>(Gold.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take which of thoſe Waters you like beſt to diſſolve a Metal.

                     <p>Having ſpoken of the Quinteſſences of Minerals <hi>(of Metallick Waters)</hi> how we are to make them, it is now convenient to ſpeak of the diviſion of them in general. And my Son! do thus; When your Metals are diſſolved, you muſt divide every Water <hi>(being firſt filtred, and diſtilled from its remainder)</hi> and every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Water <hi>(now diſtilled)</hi> into two parts, and one part of every part you muſt put with its own Faeces <hi>(the remaining Metal, which the Water had left in diſtillation)</hi> into a Glaſs Alembick, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil a <hi>Limus deſerti,</hi> which is Air made out of two Bodies, <hi>(or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals)</hi> in the Furnace, which we deſign'd you firſt with a gentle Fire, ſhining with great Mineral Luſtre, and with great limoſity appropriated to receive Celeſtial Virtues: And put every one of thoſe Waters into a Glaſs Veſſel, with a long Neck and round, and then ſtop the Mouth of it with common Wax, and after that with Maſtick, and every of thoſe Veſſels put in the open Air ſo, as that neither Stone, nor any other hurtful thing may touch the Glaſs. Son! Take the material Faeces, from which you reſolved the <hi>Limus,</hi> which are the ſecond Faeces left in the diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Waters which you put in the Air. <hi>(Take the Caput mortuum from the diſtillation of every</hi> Limus deſertus, <hi>or the third Foeces, for the firſt remaining in the Filtre were caſt away, from the ſecond the</hi> Limus deſertus <hi>was diſtilled; now the Foeces of the</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus deſertus, <hi>are thoſe which he here calls the ſecond</hi>) and put them in a Glaſs Veſſel with a long Neck, which may contain two hands breadth, and put in part of its own Water, which was reſerved from that aforeſaid limous ſubſtance, and ſtop the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels with a Stopple of Wax, and with Leather and Maſtick, as you did to the other, and Bury them <hi>(Waters of Metals)</hi> in a Garden, in an Earth half a Yard deep, and put alſo ſomething about the Neck of the Veſſels, which may appear above ground, for the preſervation of them, and let them be there for one whole Year: Son! the Waters which are put into the Earth are of one Nature, and thoſe which are put in the Air of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59727:104"/> for Son! thoſe which are put into the Earth have a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, coagulating, and fixing Virtue and Quality; and thoſe which are in the Air, have the Virtue and Property of being hardened, coagulated and fixed: The Year being ended, you will have all that is deſired in the World for this Work, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

In Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendio Animae tranſm. pag. 208. Volum. 4. Theat.

                        <hi>The Water of</hi> Luna <hi>is thus made: Take one Ounce of the pureſt Silver, diſſolve it in what quantity of the diſſolving Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you pleaſe, diſtil through a Filtre, and caſt away the firſt Faeces, then diſtil through an Alembick in the digeſtion of H.</hi> (Balneo) <hi>and keep the ſecond Faeces, you muſt keep the ſecond
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59727:105"/> Faeces of all the Waters in their own Veſſels, every one by it ſelf. Moreover</hi> (in Compendio Animoe) <hi>he divides not the diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Waters into equal parts, as</hi> in Libro Eſſentioe, <hi>but draws off the diſſolutions of Metals by diſtilling one half for the Terreſtrial Water, and diſtils the other half for the Etherial Water.

                     <p>The Waters made by the latter method are more compounded than thoſe of the firſt, the firſt were prepared promiſcuouſly with the Lunar <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> the ſecond not ſo; for the Water of Lead is made by the Lunar <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> of which Water of Lead is made the Water of Copper; of this Water of Copper is made the Water of Tin; from the Water of Tin he prepares the Water of Iron, but the Water of Gold is made with the Lunar <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> to which is added half of the Water of Iron. O wonderful mixture! I will not ſay, confuſion of Metals! yet doubtleſs the moſt acute Philoſopher had reaſons for it. This method is alſo in <hi>Lapidario, Cap. 9. &amp; ſequentibus.</hi>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59727:106"/> Philoſophers affirm: But it is enough for you to know the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Celeſtial heat, informed by the Figure of the Heaven and Stars, by reaſon of which, Virtues are infuſed into Matter being aptly appropriated, which receives them by the Natural Induſtry of an Artiſt with reſolution, which is done by Art imitating Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in this Point the Philoſophers have been miſtaken, in reprehending thoſe Men that knew, that the Celeſtial Virtue is too common to every elemented Nature; for by its great Nobleneſs it takes determination at any time, becauſe in things mixed it is influenced as well by Art as by Nature, and this is done by reaſon of the Natural Virtues, which are the ſubject and proper detainer of it in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as that it receives ſuch a Virtue, according to the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Matter, and its Kind, which afterwards effects ſuch things by Nature, as are reputed for a Miracle. In like manner let every Artiſt take Notice, that Nature cannot operate but by the ſucceſſion of the leaſt particles, nor alſo can it receive any Virtues but by the ſucceſſion of its operation, nor can they alſo do all at once, nor can the Conſtellations ſuffer the Station of any time punctually in a certain Virtue, which may not be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately varied: And it being alſo granted, that it might, the time of Conſtellation is ſo ſmall by reaſon of the Circles of revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, as that it may ſooner paſs from one Virtue to another, <hi>&amp;c.

                     <p>An ingenious Artiſt, <hi>ſaith Paracelſus,</hi> will by diligent animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion be able to prepare Metals, ſo that being guided by true reaſon, he may promote the perfection of tranſmuting Metals, by his own work or conduct better, than by Courſes of the twelve Celeſtial Signs, and ſeven Planets, which therefore to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, will be ſuperfluous, as alſo the Aſpects, the ill or good times, day or hour, the proſperous or unhappy State of this or another Planet, which cannot help, much leſs hurt in the Art of Natural Alchymy; if otherwiſe, you have a true poſſible proceſs, operate when you pleaſe; but if there be any defect in you, or your Operations, and Underſtanding, the Planets and Celeſtial Conſtellations will fail you. <hi>Coelum.

                     <p>If they alledge <hi>ſaith Geber,</hi> that the perfecting of Metals is from a certain ſituation of one or more Starrs which we know not, we anſwer, that we regard not this ſituation and motion, nor
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59727:106"/> alſo is it neceſſarily requiſite for us to know it: becauſe there is not any ſpecies of things generable and corruptible, but Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Corruption may be dayly and in every inſtant made from the individuals of it: And it is therefore manifeſt, that ſuch a poſition of the Stars is every Day good, and able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and ſimply to corrupt all the ſpecies whatſoever of Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals. It is not therefore neceſſarily expedient for an Artiſt to expect the place of the Stars, though it might be uſeful; becauſe it is ſufficient for him only to diſpoſe and adminiſter the way of Nature, that She, who is wiſe, may diſpoſe the ſituations of thoſe able Bodies agreeing: For Nature can perfect nothing without the motion and poſition of the Planets. Wherefore if you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and duly conſider the Artifice of Nature, whatſoever may be the contingents of this Magiſtery, it will be perfected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a due poſition by Nature agreeable to it, without the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it: For when we ſee a Worm produced from a putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Dog or other Animal, we do not preſently conſider the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Stars, but the diſpoſition of the ambient Air, and other cauſes conducing to putrefaction, beſides that poſition: And from ſuch a conſideration we know ſufficiently, that Worms are produced according to Nature: For Nature finds convenient places for it ſelf, though we may be ignorant of them. <hi>Summa perfect.

                        <hi>Petrus Bonus of Ferraria hath the ſame Opinion of Influences.</hi> As to the ninth reaſon, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> we ſay it is true, that Forms are introduced into things below, by the motion and light of Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Bodies, and by their particular Poſitions and Aſpects; but it is not neceſſary for us to know, nor can we know them, but in a confuſed manner, as in ſome things by the Sun, who is the cauſe of the four Seaſons of the Year; Sowing, Reaping, and Planting, being done at certain Seaſons; and in ſome Animals, as Horſes, Aſſes, and Hawks, Conjunctions are made in order to Coition and Generation at ſome certain Periods of the Sun; but in ſome theſe things are done at any time indifferently, as in Man, Pigeons, Hens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore if we would generate a Worm out of putrifying Fleſh, we do not conſider any poſition of the Stars, but only the diſpoſition of the ambient Air, and other cauſes of putrefaction: Likewiſe, if we put Eggs in Dung, or ſuch a like place for the production of Chickens, the Form will
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59727:107"/> be given at any time in the place and time predeſtinated by the Celeſtial Powers, without our conſideration herein: After the ſame manner in the Generation of Lime and Vitriol, and Gold, and Silver, or Sulphur, and Ceruſe, and Minium, and Cinabar, likewiſe in the Compoſition of Theriacle, and other Confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe theſe things may be done at any time, and any hour; for the Celeſtial Virtue is very common to all things, and is circumſcribed by the Virtues and Diſpoſitions of thoſe things, which are the ſubject of it in things Elemented and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments themſelves, becauſe, as aforeſaid, the Celeſtial Vertues do operate in the whole Nature of things capable of Generation and Corruption continually according to the diſpoſition of the Matter, either properly or commonly: Wherefore ſaid <hi>Lilium,</hi> The Work is not cauſed by the motion of the Powers above, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be done at any time. And <hi>Raſis in</hi> 70. <hi>in Libro Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſionis:</hi> Time operates not any thing in this; <hi>and adds</hi> becauſe ſhould time operate in it, it would be of no eſteem amongſt the People. If therefore all contingents in this Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery concur rightly in their time, their Form will be introduced under a due Poſition and Aſpect of the Stars, at the time prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Matter, without any conſideration herein: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid <hi>Plato,</hi> According to the merit of the Matter, are the Celeſtial Virtues infuſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as to thoſe things, in which an accidental, new, and hidden Form is infuſed by the Celeſtial Powers, as is manifeſt in <hi>Arte Imaginum Coeleſtium,</hi> it is neceſſary for us to know and obſerve the determined Poſitions and Aſpects of the Celeſtial Bodies, according to the time propoſed: Becauſe ſuch a Form is imprinted by ſuch alone, and at ſuch a time and no other, as appears in the Books of Aſtrology concerning the Election of Hours, Images, and Wars, Buildings, Journey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore Alchymy being no ſuch Art, therefore is it not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for a Man to know theſe things. <hi>Margar. pretioſa, Pag.</hi> 731: <hi>Vol.</hi> 5. <hi>Th.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59727:108"/> with the Menſtrual Water, and the Fire with the Air and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Earth ſubliming with the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and cauſe it to paſs through the Alembick with the ſame <hi>Menſtruum.</hi> Thus have you, my Son! the Elements of the white Sulphur, and the Elements of the red Sulphur ſeparated and divided: Now take the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> or Water with which you ſeparated the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Sulphurs of Gold and Silver, and for every Pound of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> in which you diſſolved the Gold, diſſolve one Ounce of Gold; and in the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> wherein you diſſolv'd the Silver, an Ounce of Silver; and put either of them by it ſelf in a Veſſel of Circulation in Balneo or Dung, the ſpace of fifteen Days, and there it will be ſtrengthened into its Menſtrual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: This Water, Son! we call Elemented <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> or Water waſhed and drawn from the Faeces of the Earth. Now take the two Elements, namely, the Air and Fire of the Sulphur of Gold, put them together into a Glaſs diſtilling Veſſel, and diſtil in Aſhes with a moſt temperate heat, till you have three parts of five diſtilled in the Receiver, then let it cool, and that which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled receive by it ſelf, and diſtil it ſeven times, and keep it apart, then diſtil that which you left; when you have diſtilled three parts of five, continue diſtilling the two which remained, till you ſee the Fire congealed at the ſides of the Veſſel, let it cool till the Fire be congealed: And that Fire which you drew off till the Fire was congealed, <hi>(he means that which aſcends as yet moiſt before the ſublimation of the Matter from theſe two parts left)</hi> is called the ſecond Air and Tincture, and we call it our Secret, and our Treaſure, and the Vapour of the Elements: This, my Son! you muſt rectify by ſeven diſtillations or rectifications, and the Earth, which after the diſtillation of the firſt and ſecond Air you drew out of the Veſſels, in which you diſtilled the firſt and ſecond Air, put in the Fire to be congealed, and that Earth is called Fire: Now Son! prepare this Fire after this manner. Put it in a diſtilling Veſſel, and upon it pour its own Water, which is that wherewith you ſeparated the Elements of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of Gold, when we commanded to reduce it to a fifth Spirit in the Veſſel of <hi>Hermes,</hi> and ſaid, Take the Water waſh'd from the Faeces of the Earth (<hi>otherwiſe the Elemented</hi> Menſtruum <hi>of</hi> Sol) five parts of its weight, that is, five Ounces of the ſaid Water (<hi>Elemented</hi> Menſtruum <hi>of Gold</hi>) to one Ounce of the ſaid
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59727:109"/> Fire, and digeſt in Balneo eight Days, then diſtil in Aſhes moſt gently, and again put new Water, namely, five parts, digeſt and diſtil as before, repeating this method ſeven times, and ſo you have the Fire and Earth <hi>(of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of Gold)</hi> calcined by Philoſophical calcination; and they are the two Elements of the red Sulphur prepared for the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert Limes.</hi> And take notice, that you muſt put the Earth of the white Sulphur, which you calcined and prepared after the ſeparation of the Elements of the red Sulphur with the Earth, which you drew from the Air mix'd with the Fire, and put both with the Fire congealed. Now Son! take the Earth of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of Silver, which remained after the ſeparation of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and prepare it, as you did in calcining and preparing the Earth of Gold, after the ſeparation of the Elements ſublimed together with the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and reduced into an impalpable Powder, and carryed through the Alembick with the ſame <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum.</hi> You may alſo prepare the Earth of the Sulphur of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> that you uſed in ſeparating the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Sulphur of Silver: Then have you the Earths of the Sulphur of Gold and Silver prepared by themſelves, which you will know by the ſign given you, that is, putting a little of it upon a red hot Plate of <hi>Luna,</hi> the greater part will fume away: Then take thoſe Earths in equal weight and ounces, and put them in a preparing Veſſel, then take the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> with which you prepared the Elements of <hi>Luna,</hi> and in one Pound of it, put one Ounce of the Vegetable Sulphur, which we ſhewed you how to make from the Earth of Wine (<hi>Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Sal Armoniack <hi>made of the Earth of</hi> Philoſophical Wine) and diſtilling, make the whole paſs through the Alembick, and then will you have the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> with which you extracted the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Sulphur of <hi>Luna,</hi> animated and acuated: Then Son! you muſt mix and prepare the Earths of the aforeſaid Sulphurs <hi>(that is of Gold and Silver)</hi> together, allowing of the ſaid <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum,</hi> now animated and acuated, a fourth part of their weight, digeſting and drying, as is done in the making of the Sulphur (<hi>of Nature, or</hi> Sal Armoniack) till they have drank up four parts of the ſaid <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and are diſpoſed to ſublimation, which you muſt ſublime with a Fire of the fourth degree: And ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that all thoſe preparations and diſtillations of the Earths
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59727:109"/> are to be done in Balneo: And thus, Son! have you <hi>our Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur or Matter, or Vegetable and Metallick Earth in one Kind united,</hi> for the making of the Glorious, High, and Virtuous Stone, which will transform common <hi>Argent vive</hi> into perfect <hi>Sol</hi> or <hi>Luna,</hi> without the help of Fire, but as the Eye of a Baſilisk, which kills Animals by ſight alone: But it is your intereſt Son! to uſe great diligence, and exquiſite Ingenuity in making the Roots of this high and lofty Tree, which Roots we call <hi>deſert Limes,</hi> in which the whole Virtue of Heaven and Earth relating to this Magiſtery will be infuſed: And the way is this,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Vegetable <hi>(and Mineral) Earth or Sulphur, which you united in one Kind,</hi> by ſublimation, which is that which you call'd the <hi>Earth of Sulphur in one Kind united,</hi> put it in a Glaſs Veſſel, and pour ſo much as it weighs of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> with which you ſeparated the Elements of the Sulphur of <hi>Luna,</hi> and prepared the ſaid kind of Earth, and put it in a Philoſophical Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo three Natural Days, and in that time it will be all diſſolved, which being thus diſſolved, put in a common Balneo, and diſtil the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and <hi>the Earth united to its kind</hi> will by ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion remain as an Oyl, which we call the Philoſophers Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and it is one of the Secrets, which we take care to have concealed: Then,</p>
                     <p>Take of that Oyl or Oyntment aforeſaid ten Drachms, and of the rectify'd Air of the Sulphur of <hi>Luna</hi> one Drachm (<hi>not one Ounce: And of the Air of the Sulphur of</hi> Sol <hi>one Drachm</hi>) and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil in a Fire of Aſhes, and that which is diſtilled, which is almoſt all, is called the Terreſtrial <hi>deſert Limes,</hi> keep it.

                     <p>Take of the Element of the Fire of the Sulphur of Gold one Drachm or two, and rectifie it again thus, pouring upon it fiVe parts of its own <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> which is that, with which you ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the Elements of the ſame Sulphur of Gold, and put it to digeſt in Balneo for one Natural Day, then diſtil in Aſhes what you can: And again pour the ſaid <hi>Menſtruum</hi> upon it, digeſt and

                     <p>Take of the ſaid Earth <hi>(in one kind united)</hi> one Drachm, and of the Oyl of the Air <hi>(of the Sulphur)</hi> of <hi>Luna</hi> one Drachm, mix them together, and you will make the ſame Magiſtery, as you did with the precedent Gold, and it is called the Terreſtrial <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert Limes lunificated (not) vaporized.</hi>

                     <p>We do now think good to ſhew the way of celificating and preparing thoſe <hi>(Limes)</hi> in order to receive the Virtues of Heaven and Earth, and the way is this: Take Braſs or Iron Cages, and let them be like thoſe wherein Parrots whiſtle, but the twiggs muſt be cloſer, ſo that no Earth, neither Celeſtial nor Terreſtrial can enter, but only the vapour of Heaven and Earth, which you will have by Influence.</p>
                     <p>Take the <hi>Limes (above mentioned, Terreſtrial deſert)</hi> made of ten drachms of the Earth or Sulphur united, which is that which you united with the Earth of the Sulphur of Silver, and reduced into an Oyl or Oyntment; and of one Drachm of the Air <hi>(of the Sulphur)</hi> of <hi>Luna,</hi> and one Drachm of the Air <hi>(of Sol)</hi> mix'd, and that <hi>Limes</hi> put in a Glaſs Veſſel with a long Neck exactly Sealed with the Seal of <hi>Hermes,</hi> and put it in the Cage, and ſet it one Arm or two deep, and let it ſtand a Year and half, or at leaſt a Year, covering it well with Earth, and keeping it from all dangers, and in that time will it be made a powerful Water, with wonderful fixative Virtues of the Stone, and it hath admirable Virtues acquired from Heaven, which it attracted from the Vapours of the Earth. Son! depend upon this.</p>
                     <p>Take the <hi>Limes (above declared, Etherial deſert,)</hi> which you made of ten Drachms of the Fire of the Sulphur of Gold, and of one Drachm of the Air of the Sulphur of <hi>Luna (and one Drachm of the Air of the Sulphur of</hi> Sol) and put it in another Glaſs Veſſel with a long Neck Hermetically Sealed, and put it in another Cage, and hang it in the Air on a Tree, or any private place, free from all Wind, Duſt, and Danger; leave it a Year and half, or a whole Year at leaſt, as we ſaid of the other, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59727:110"/> ſo will be made a clear Water endowed with the Virtue of hardning, fixing, congealing, penetrating, and making the Stone Volatile, and is called the Mercury of Air of moſt acute penetration.</p>
                     <p>Take the <hi>(Terreſtrial deſert) Limes</hi> of Gold not vaporized, nor celificated <hi>(neither diſtilled through an Alembick, nor circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)</hi> which is that, that you made <hi>(by meerly mixing)</hi> of one Drachm of the Element of the Fire of the Sulphur of <hi>Sol,</hi> and of one Drachm of <hi>the Earth (united in its Kind)</hi> and that <hi>(take alſo the Terreſtrial deſert Limes lunificated, not vaporized)</hi> which you made out of one Drachm of <hi>the Earth of Sulphur united,</hi> and one Drachm of the Air <hi>(of the Sulphur)</hi> of <hi>Luna,</hi> and put thoſe <hi>Limes</hi> every one by it ſelf in a Glaſs Veſſel Sealed, as was ſaid of the other, and put it in the Earth the depth of one Arm for a whole Year in a Cage, and in that time will be made a Water of wonderful Virtue in joyning Bodies, and content your ſelf with this.</p>
                     <p>Take the <hi>Limes</hi> which you made out of ten Drachms of the Fire or Air, and one of the Earth; and take that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the Air <hi>(of the Sulphur)</hi> of <hi>Luna,</hi> becauſe you took but three Drachms of it, when you made the <hi>Limes,</hi> and let it hang in the Air in a Glaſs Veſſel Sealed, and in a Cage, as you did with the other, and there will it receive the Celeſtial Virtues, which are the means of Conjunction between the <hi>Limes of the Earth, and the Limes of the Fire,</hi> and other <hi>Limes</hi> alſo.</p>
                     <p>Take the ſecond Air (<hi>the</hi> Menſtruum <hi>Elemented, in which were diſſolved the Air and Fire of the Sulphur of Gold, and gently drawn off, that is, three parts only from five of it</hi>) which is that, which you drew from the Fire congeled, which we call'd Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Oyl, and Philoſophical Treaſure <hi>(not that, which is alſo called the Philoſophers Oyntment, made of the Earth united in one Kind, but that which was call'd the Vapour of the Elements)</hi> and put it by it ſelf in another Glaſs Veſſel well Sealed, and put it in the Air near the other, which you put for a whole Year.</p>
                     <p>Take the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> with which you ſeparated the Elements of the Sulphur of <hi>Luna (and that</hi> Menſtruum, <hi>wherewith you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated the Elements of the Sulphur of</hi> Sol) and put in every Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, wherein is <hi>Menſtruum</hi> of <hi>Luna (and the</hi> Menſtruum of <hi>Sol</hi>) one Drachm of Sulphur (<hi>or Vegetable</hi> Sal Harmoniack) and ſet
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59727:111"/> it in Balneo, then in Aſhes, till you have made it all go over with every <hi>Menſtruum</hi> by it ſelf: Then each <hi>Menſtruum</hi> being thus recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd or animated, put in a Glaſs Veſſel Sealed by themſelves in their Cages, and hang them in the Air near the other, for a Year.</p>
                     <p>Take the Oleagineity of <hi>Luna (the firſt, or firſt Air)</hi> which is that, which you drew from the Earth of <hi>Luna,</hi> when you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared it for the making of the Sulphur of <hi>Luna,</hi> which we commanded you to keep, and ſaid it ſhould be for the making <hi>(of the Sulphur of Nature)</hi> put it in a Glaſs Veſſel Sealed in the Air, and there it will be made a Fluxible and Virtuous Water of wonderful penetration: And what we ſaid of the white Oyl, we ſay alſo of the red incerative Oyl <hi>(of Sol.)</hi> And now Son! you have the Stone <hi>(Menſtruum)</hi> divided into eight parts, three in the Earth, and five in the Air.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> by <hi>Green Lyon,</hi> the Philoſophers means the Sun, which by its attractive Virtue makes things Green, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the whole World. <hi>Tract. de.

                     <p>Secondly, It is moreover alſo called Green, becauſe that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is as yet ſharp and unripe, that is, not yet fixed or perfected by Nature, as common Gold.

                     <p>Thirdly, It may alſo be called <hi>Lyon,</hi> becauſe as all other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals give place to a <hi>Lyon,</hi> ſo all Bodies yield to the power of <hi>Gold vive,</hi> which is our Mercury. <hi>Tract. Adrop. Pag.</hi> 548.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, This Noble Infant is called <hi>Green Lyon,</hi> becauſe when it is diſſolved, it is cloathed with a Green Garment.

And to theſe Sayings ſeems to aſſent <hi>Guido,</hi> the Greek Philoſopher, ſpeaking of the Mercurial or Menſtrual Spirit (<hi>the Spirit or Blood of the</hi> Green Lyon) which is extracted out of the Natural <hi>Adrop</hi> by Art, where he writes: And that Spirit is <hi>Sol</hi> extracted out of the Philoſophers <hi>Solary Water, Arſenick,</hi> and <hi>Luna:</hi> And in the ſame place preſently adds; The Body is the ferment of the Spirit, and the Spirit the ferment of the Body, and the Earth, wherein lies the Fire, dries, imbibes, and fixeth the Water; and the Air, wherein lies the Water, <hi>(the Air which lies in the Water,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59727:114"/> it ought to be read according to the Doctrine of ſeparating the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)</hi> waſheth, tingeth, and perfecteth the Earth and Fire; and ſo <hi>Guido</hi>'s Saying, that they tinge and perfect, ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that the Stone (<hi>the</hi> Menſtruum <hi>drawn from</hi> Adrop, <hi>or the</hi> Green Lyon) is ſufficient for the compleating of it ſelf into an <hi>Elixir,</hi> and that no Exotick or Heterogeneous Matter, as he affirms, is or ought to be introduced to it, but all the parts of it are co-eſſential and concrete, becauſe the Philoſophers meaning was to compleat that work in a ſhort ſpace above the Earth, which Nature ſcarce perfecteth in a thouſand Years under the Earth: Unskilfully therefore according to the Opinion of the Philoſophers, as <hi>Guido</hi> ſaith, do they proceed, that ſeek to obtain a ferment from common Silver and Gold for our ſelect Body: For that Matter, in which is <hi>Argent vive</hi> clean and pure, not <hi>(moſt, is ill read)</hi> throughly brought to perfection by Nature, is, as <hi>Guido</hi> affirms, after compleat purification, a thouſand times better than the Bodies of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> vulgarly decocted by the Natural heat of the Sun. <hi>Concord. Lully &amp; Guidon. Pag.</hi> 323. A certain Philoſopher ſaith, <hi>He goes on Diſcourſing of the ſame</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drop; A fume <hi>(white)</hi> is drawn from its own Mines, which if rightly gathered, and again ſprinkled upon its own Mines, will there make a fixation, and ſo the true <hi>Elixir</hi> will in a ſhort ſpace of time be produced from it: And certainly without thoſe Liquors or Spirits, that is, the Water and Oyl of Mercury <hi>(Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum)</hi> this Alchymical Body which is <hi>Neutral</hi> or <hi>Adrop,</hi> is not purged: And that is the Alchymical Body, which is called Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous Body, that is, black <hi>(at the beginning of the Work)</hi> in which, as ſaith <hi>Vincentius</hi> in his <hi>Speculum Naturale,</hi> are Gold and Silver in power, and not in aſpect; which in the Bowels of it is alſo airy Gold, to which no Man can attain, except the unclean Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be firſt cleanſed, which is without doubt after its compleat dealbation, and then it is a thouſand times better than are the Bodies of common Gold and Silver decocted by Natural heat: The firſt Matter of this Leprous Body is a viſcous Water inſpiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Bowels of the Earth: Of this Body, according to the Judgment of <hi>Vincentius,</hi> is made the great <hi>Elixir</hi> for the red and white, the Name whereof is <hi>Adrop,</hi> otherwiſe called the Philoſophers black Lead, out which <hi>Raymund</hi> commands us to extract an Oyl of a Golden Colour, or ſuch like: <hi>Raymund</hi> adds,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59727:115"/> But this Oyl is not neceſſary in the Vegetable Work <hi>(namely, for the inceration of the Vegetable Stone)</hi> becauſe ſolutions and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulations are there ſoon made; and if you can ſeparate it from its Phlegm, and after that ingeniouſly find out the Secrets of it, you will in thirty Days be able to perfect the Philoſophers Stone: For this Oyl makes Medecines <hi>(Tinctures)</hi> penetrable, ſociable, and amicable to all Bodies, and in the World there is not a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Secret. <hi>Medul.

                     <p>Ripley <hi>hath here recited various Synonima's of this</hi> Adrop: <hi>We for a time will follow the</hi> Green Lyon <hi>by the way of</hi> Philoſophical Lead, <hi>as we are directed by</hi> Ripley <hi>in theſe very Words:</hi> Firſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, when <hi>Avecenn</hi> ſaith, that Gold and Silver are in Lead by Power, and not by ſight, and they are left by Nature crude and half cocted, and therefore that ought to be perfectly ſupplyed by Art, which is left imperfect by Nature, and by way of a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment digeſting and cocting that which is left crude: For a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therefore take perfect Gold, for a little <hi>(paululum, not paula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim)</hi> of their fixed ſubſtance <hi>(thoſe fixed Bodies)</hi> will draw and convert much of Bodies not fixed to the perfection of Gold and Silver. And thus will Art help Nature, that in a little ſpace of time that may be done above the Earth, which is not in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years done under the Earth: And by this means you will underſtand, how Lead contains in it the greateſt Secrets of this Art: For it hath in it <hi>Argent vive,</hi> clean, pure, odoriferous, not brought by Nature to perfection: And this <hi>Argent vive</hi> is the Baſis and Ground-Work of our pretious Medicine, as well for Metallick as Humane Bodies, ſo as to be the <hi>Elixir</hi> of Life, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all infirmities: Which the Philoſopher meant, ſaying, There is in Mercury whatſoever Wiſe Men ſeek: From this are the Soul, Body, Spirit, and Tincture drawn: Moreover alſo in this Mercury is the Philoſophers Fire, always burning equally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Veſſel, and not without: It hath alſo a great attractive Virtue and Power in diſſolving <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> and reducing the ſame into their firſt Matter: With this Mercury are to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the Calxes of the perfect Bodies in congealing the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Mercurial Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.

                        <hi>WE take notice that the</hi> Menſtruums <hi>of the antecedent Kind are made of the unctuous Matter of</hi> Philoſophical Wine, <hi>purged, diſſolved, and volatilized with an acid; in the preſent we ſhall obſerve the contrary, namely, that the acid or ſaline</hi> Eſſences <hi>of</hi> Salts <hi>made with the unctuous Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine, <hi>are</hi> Menſtruums <hi>of this fourteenth Kind.</hi> Paracelſus <hi>in the preſcribed Receipt reduced Salts by cohobation alone, with the Water of Salt
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59727:132"/> circulated into a liquid ſubſtance or Oyl, but the Oyl made of common Salt, by the method aforeſaid, he commends before the reſt to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, for the extractions of Metallick Bodies.</hi> Certainly, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> there cannot be a more Noble and better way, than by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Oyl of Salt, prepared as we have clearly deſcribed in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymia (and in Libris Chyrurgicis.)</hi> For this Water fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and radically extracts out of all Metallick Bodies their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Liquor or Sulphur, and a moſt excellent <hi>Crocus</hi> as well for Medicinal as Chymical Operations: It reſolves and breaks any Metal whatſoever, converting it out of its own Metallick Nature into another, according to the various intention and induſtry of the Operator. <hi>Manuale de Lap.

                     <p>
                        <hi>It will therefore be worth while to explain the way of making this</hi> Oyl <hi>of</hi> Salt <hi>more clearly to you: Firſt for the illuſtration of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt we will propoſe the Deſcription of the</hi> Oyl <hi>of</hi> Salt <hi>alleadged by the Author himſelf, in the eighth Book of his Archidoxes, which in the</hi> Elixir <hi>of Salt,</hi> Pag. 31. <hi>we read thus:</hi> Take Salt accurately prepared moſt white, and moſt pure; put it into a Pellican with ſuch a quantity of the diſſolving Water, as to exceed the weight of it ſix times: Digeſt them in Horſe-Dung together the ſpace of a Month, then ſeparate the diſſolving Water by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation, pour it again to it, and ſeparate as before, and that ſo oft, till the Salt is converted into Oyl.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>By comparing the Receipts it appears, that Sea-Salt newly made is not to be underſtood by new Salt, but the ſame exquiſitely purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Then it is clear, that the weight of the Water of the circulated Salt omitted in the Receipt of the tenth Book, ought to be ſo deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, as to be ſix times more than the weight of the Salt: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the time and place of putrefaction omitted in the former proceſs are deſcribed in the other, that is, to be digeſted a Month in Horſe-Dung: Beſides it is from the Receipts obſerved, that all the Salt is not converted into Oyl, the Body of the Salt being drawn as a Phlegm from the</hi> Eſſence. <hi>Laſtly, that the Oyls of Vitriol and Tartar may be alſo made by the ſame method.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Receipts being thus compared, are not only without all obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but do by the exuberance of their Light give Light alſo to other Proceſſes, being otherwiſe leſs intelligible. So this</hi> Oyl <hi>of</hi> Salt, <hi>as the</hi> Eſſence <hi>or</hi> primum Ens <hi>of Salt explains that more obſcure Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the</hi> Eſſence <hi>of</hi> Salts, <hi>given in</hi> Libro 4. Archid. Pag. 14. Take
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59727:132"/> Salts, and calcine them throughly; if they be Volatile, burn <hi>(ſublime)</hi> them, after that reſolve them into a tenuity <hi>(per deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium)</hi> and diſtil them into a Water <hi>(through a Filter.)</hi> This Water putrefy <hi>(not by it ſelf, but as the Diſciples of the Art ought to underſtand and know, with the Water of Salt circulated)</hi> for a Month, and diſtil by Balneo, and a ſweet Water will aſcend <hi>(the Body of the Salt by the way of a Phlegm)</hi> which caſt away: That which will not aſcend, digeſt again <hi>(with new diſſolving Water)</hi> another Month, and diſtil as before, and that ſo oft, till no more ſweetneſs is perceived. By this way you have now the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of Salt in the bottom, <hi>(like an Oyl)</hi> ſcarce two Ounces out of a Pound of the burned or calcined Salt. One Ounce of this Salt thus extracted, if common, ſeaſoneth Meat more than half a Pound of another; for the Quinteſſence of it remains only, and the Body is drawn from it by liquid ſolution. This way is the Quinteſſence of all Salts ſeparated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This Proceſs being thus enlightned by the rayes of the antecedent, reflects no ſmall Light upon the ſaid Receipts, namely, that ſcarce two Ounces are acquired from one Pound of the Salts.</hi>

                     <p>In Clavi Archidoxorum, Lib. 10. Pag. 37. <hi>Paracelſus has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the</hi> Eſſences <hi>of</hi> Salts <hi>in theſe Words:</hi> The way of extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Quinteſſence of Salts, as Vitriol, Salt, Nitre, Tartar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is this: Cohobate with its own Liquor or Water very often, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trify with the Phlegm, and then draw off the Body in the form of Phlegm even to the fixed Spirit: This Spirit diſſolve in its own Water, and by a ſtrong heat ſeparate the pure from the impure with the Spirit of Wine. <hi>This Deſcription is moſt obſcure, but made clearer by thoſe aforeſaid. The meaning of</hi> Paracelſus <hi>is this: He putrefies the Salts, and cohobates them ſo often with their own Liquors or Waters, that is, with their own</hi> Circulatums; <hi>common Salt with common Salt circulated; Nitre with Nitre circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; Vitriol with the Water of Vitriol circulated; Alume with the Water of Alume circulated, the diſſolving Water of Alume, the</hi> Circulatum minus <hi>of Alume,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>till they remain at the bottom in the form of an Oyl, which Oyl being either acid or ſaline, eaſily makes an efferveſcence with the unctuous Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine <hi>or its own</hi> Circulatum, <hi>and in this heat lets fall ſome of its impurities, and ſo becomes purer, which thing is confirmed by the Deſcription it ſelf of the Water of Salt circulated, where he putrefies Salt, being
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59727:133"/> melted and reſolved</hi> per deliquium, <hi>with the Spirit of</hi> Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Wine, <hi>cohobates, and draws it to an Oleity:</hi> Joyn it, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> with the Spirit of <hi>(Philoſophical) Wine,</hi> and the impure will fall to the bottom, which ſeparate, but let the pure be Criſtallized in a cold place, pour the diſtillation to it again, and cohobate ſo oft, till a fixed Oyl remains at the bottom, and nothing ſweet will more diſtill.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moreover, this</hi> Oyl <hi>of</hi> Salt <hi>as a</hi> Menſtruum, <hi>makes his Proceſs in</hi> Chyrurgia <hi>intelligible, which otherwiſe could not be underſtood.</hi>

One thing that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59727:133"/> mades the latter Proceſs inexplicable, is the unknown Juice of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinea,</hi> but however it is evident by what hath been ſaid, that either the Spirit of <hi>Philoſophical Wine,</hi> or the Water of Salt circulated ſupplies its place. <hi>Baſilius</hi> indeed reſolved common Salt with the Spirit of <hi>Philoſophical Wine</hi> not into an Oyl; but reduced into it a Green Stone thus:</p>

                     <p>TAke common Salt, calcine it well, yet without fuſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to a Powder, reſolve <hi>per deliquium</hi> in a Cellar, or in <hi>Raphanus</hi> made hollow, then diſtil in Sand with a quick Fire, and a Water will aſcend, the reſidue in the bottom pulverize, and diſſolve it in its diſtilled Water, and diſtil again; this repeat till all the Salt has aſcended, which will be in the fourth or fifth time: Draw off the Phlegm from the diſtilled Water in Balneo, the remainder put into a Cellar in cold Water, and you will have Criſtals, which take out, and diſſolve in the Phlegm; then draw off one half, and you will find new Criſtals, repeat the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion four times or more, for the oftner, the more fuſible will be the Criſtals, which being dryed and pulverized on a Marble, pour to them the rectify'd Spirit of <hi>(Philoſophical) Wine,</hi> which cohobate from the Salt ſo oft, till you perceive the Oyl of Salt coagulated into a Green tranſparent Stone, which reſerve.</p>
                     <p>Paracelſus <hi>in his Receipts appointed the calcination of Salt to be done by the fuſion of it; but in this Proceſs</hi> Baſilius <hi>prohibits this liquefaction of Salt, wherefore we conclude it to be little eſſential in the ſaid depuration of Salt, nor do we think it ſo neceſſary, for the Salt being reſolved</hi> per deliquium <hi>to be diſtilled, thereby to be made a fuſible Salt;</hi> Paracelſus <hi>having taught how to make the ſame Oyl out of fuſed Salt, which Oyl</hi> Paracelſus <hi>himſelf, beſides</hi> Baſilius, <hi>in many places affirms to be of a Green Colour.

Chym. <hi>to practiſe upon the</hi> Calx <hi>of a</hi> (Metallick) <hi>Body duly calcined: The Body therefore being prepared, pour upon it ſo much of this compounded water (in</hi> Numb. <hi>70.) as to cover it half an inch, and it will preſently boil upon the</hi> Calxes <hi>of the Body without any external heat, diſſolving the Body, and elevating it in the form of Ice, together with the exficcation of it ſelf, which muſt be taken away by the hand of the Operator: And the remaining</hi> Calxes <hi>being well dried again by Fire, put ſo much water to them as before, and proceed in all things as before, continuing the ſame way of operating, till all the</hi> Calxes <hi>be well diſſolved: which ſubſtance being well diſſolved, neatly ſeparated, and pulverized, muſt be put into a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the rectify'd water of the Fire of Nature</hi> (Spirit of Philoſophical Wine) <hi>that in that Veſſel well ſtopp'd it may by the adminiſtration of external heat, together with the excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of internal heat, be diſſolved into an Oyl, which will ſoon be done,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>When the</hi> Menſtruum (of Sericon, in Numb. <hi>63.) is poured upon the aforeſaid</hi> Calxes (of Metals) <hi>it begins to boyl up; and if the Veſſel be well ſtopp'd, it will not leave working, though no external Fire be adminiſtred to it, till it be dried into the</hi> Calx; <hi>wherefore you muſt not put a greater quantity of it than juſt to cover the</hi> Calxes. In the ſame place, pag. <hi>171. For in this Operation the leſs of the Spirit, and the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59727:134"/> more of the Body is put, the better and ſooner will be the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, which is made by the congelation of the Water. You muſt have a care therefore, as it is ſaid in the</hi> Roſary, <hi>that the Belly be not too moiſt, becauſe then the Matter would not receive drineſs: And this way muſt be obſerved, till all the water be dried up.</hi> The ſame Place, <hi>pag. 161.</hi>

                        <hi>5.</hi> That all the ſharpneſs of this Metallick Powder may be waſh'd away with ſweet water. That the <hi>Menſtruums</hi> of the <hi>Adepts</hi> are permanent, is manifeſt by the ways of making them; but more clearly by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of them in the Receipts of the following Books: However <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſeeming to have appointed the contrary by the preſent ablution of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> leſt therefore you ſhould fall into the greateſt and moſt dangerous Errour of all the <hi>Adeptical Chymy,</hi> we thought good to communicate to you an Obſervation or two about the permanence of <hi>Menſtruums.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>Aqua ardens,</hi> the Philoſophical that is, is by dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion or circulation divided into Phlegm and Oyl ſwimming upon it, as you obſerved in making the Eſſence or Spirit of <hi>Philoſophical Wine.</hi> You have taken alſo notice that the ſame <hi>Aqua ardens,</hi> or ſame Oyl made of it, is further concentrated, and rejects the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Phlegm, but that it ſelf as a meer <hi>Oleoſum,</hi> remains with the inanimated Earths ſo called, in the Preparations as well of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, as Mineral <hi>Sal-Harmoniacks:</hi> For it is impoſſible for the ſaid Phlegm being the vehicle of the unctuous Spirit to abide with things diſſolved, much leſs be fixed with them, they being ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it: wherefore the permanence of <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> but rather of the Spirit of <hi>Philoſophical Wine</hi> is eaſie to be underſtood, namely, as theſe <hi>Menſtruums</hi> are unctuous mixed with dry things, not in the leaſt diluted in their aquoſities, which do all ſeparate themſelves as uſeleſs in fixation. Examples you will have in <hi>Lib. 2. De Aſtris &amp; Arcanis,</hi> and often in <hi>Lib. 3.</hi> of <hi>Philoſophical Tinctures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Theſe <hi>Menſtruums</hi> do not preſently, or at the firſt time abide with their diſſolutions: For ſometimes, nay more than often, we are forced to pour on and cohabate before any part of it will continue with the diſſolved Body, whereas in the mean time the reſt aſcends unaltered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Nor do the <hi>Menſtruums</hi> perſiſt with all things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly, but are united only to things homogeneous to them, which
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59727:135"/> in reaſon they ſhould remain with. Thus the <hi>Simple Vegetable Menſtruums</hi> do continue with <hi>Eſſences,</hi> but not with their relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed white Bodies; whereas the <hi>Compounded Vegetable Menſtruums</hi> being ſutable to theſe Bodies, do diſſolve them wholly in the making of <hi>Magiſteries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Yea though every <hi>Menſtruum</hi> is either an <hi>Eſſence,</hi> or a <hi>Magiſtery,</hi> and one <hi>Eſſence</hi> prepares another, eaſily entring and mixing themſelves radically one with another, yet ſo long as they are of different kinds or degrees, are they both ſeparable again, nor do they continue; till one being newly extracted, is raiſed to the ſame degree as the other, then do they flow together at length into a mixture not to be ſeparated by Art or Nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> As to theſe Mineral <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> you have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the <hi>Acidity</hi> of them admits of the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the Phlegm or Aquofity of the <hi>Vegetable Menſtruums,</hi> ſo far as it is moiſt, and therefore to be ſeparated in the fixations of things: But as it conſiſts of the dry Particles of Mineral Salts, (but Salts they are dry things diſſolved in Acids) it will fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two ſeveral Conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt, the Acidity of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> being perhaps in greater plenty than is neceſſary, or ſticking about the ſuperficies of the thing diſſolved, is eaſily waſhed away with common Water.</p>
                     <p>But in the ſecond, the ſame Acidity being more artificially mixt, and abſorbed by the Aridity of the thing diſſolved, is made the cauſe of venenoſity, and now cannot be altered but by <hi>Vegetable Menſtruums</hi> tranſmuting it. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> commands the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not of the <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> but the ſharpneſs of the <hi>Salt,</hi> which penetrates not into the ſubſtance of the Metal, and is eaſily waſhed away, but the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctuoſity of the <hi>Salt</hi> being throughly mixed with the unctuous <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Philoſophical Wine;</hi> and now united to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctuoſity of the Metal, common Water cannot touch nor ſeparate. But an Acid received into the bowels of an Arid, he corrects again with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Philoſophical Wine,</hi> that it may not become the cauſe of venenoſity: Yet there is a place in <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> where he ſeems to have eſtabliſhed a particular Decree againſt the perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of <hi>Menſtruums. Many ſeveral ways,</hi> ſaith he, Lib. <hi>4.</hi> Archid. de Eſſentia, pag. <hi>12. are found, whereby the Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence may be extracted,</hi> viz. <hi>by Sublimation, Calcination, by</hi> Aqua fortiſſes, <hi>by Corroſives, by Sweet, by Sowr,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It may
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59727:135"/> be done which way you pleaſe: Where this is withal to be obſerved, that every thing added by way of mixture, to the Quinteſſence, for the neceſſity of extraction, muſt be again taken away, and ſo the Quinteſſence remain alone, not mix'd, or polluted with any other Matters: For the Quinteſſence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be extracted from Metals, eſpecially Gold, which cannot be ſubdued by it ſelf alone; but ſome fit Corroſive muſt be made Uſe of, which may afterwards be ſeparated from it again; ſo Salt</hi> (diſſolved) <hi>in water, is drawn again from the water left void of Salt: Whereas notwithſtanding it muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that every Corroſive is not fit for this purpoſe, becauſe they cannot all be ſeparated: For if Vitriol or Alume be mix'd with water, neither can be ſeparated from it again without detriment or corruption, but will leave ſome ſharpneſs behind them, becauſe they are both watry; and two likes concur to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which ought not to be in this place: Wherefore it is to be adviſed, not to put watry to watry, or oyley to oyley, nor reſiny to reſiny, but a thing contrary muſt ſeparate the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence, and extract it, as waters extract the Quinteſſences of things oleaginous, and the oleaginous the Quinteſſences of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try things, as we may learn by the Quinteſſences of Herbs: The Corroſives therefore are to be ſeparated again after the ſeparation and extraction of the Quinteſſence, which may eaſily be done; for oyl and water are ſeparated with eaſe; but oyl cannot be drawn from oyl, nor water likewiſe from water without mixing, which being leſt, would indeed infer very great detriment to the Quinteſſence: For a Quinteſſence ought to be clear and pure without any mixture, ſo as to have an uniform ſubſtance, by virtue whereof to penetrate the whole Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Leſt the Eſſence ſhould be defiled by things added for the neceſſity of extraction, he commands no Watry Matter to be extracted by a watry <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> an oyley by an oyley, a reſiny by a reſiny, but by ſome contrary. This Rule, if underſtood according to the Letter, is erroneous, for it takes away all the permanence of <hi>Menſtruums</hi> eſtabliſhed upon the Maxime ſo often repeated by the <hi>Adepts; The Diſſolution of the Body is the Coagulation of the Spirit or</hi> Menſtruum; <hi>and on the contrary:</hi> It takes away, I ſay, all the natural homogeneity of the diſſolvent and the diſſolved; yea
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59727:136"/> is repugnant to the Experience of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> himſelf, who had no <hi>Menſtruum</hi> but what remained in a radical mixtion with the things diſſolved in it, as by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of them we ſhall prove hereafter. Now an Eſſence is divers ways coinquinated by things added in the extraction of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> When a Natural or Seminal <hi>Eſſence</hi> is extracted by the like Natural <hi>Eſſence</hi> of another ſpecies; For example, the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Saffron</hi> is inquinated and confounded with the virtues of <hi>Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom,</hi> in extracting it with the ſpecifick <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Cinamom,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Eſſences</hi> of Vegetables are not to be extracted with a Natural, or rather Artificial <hi>Eſſence,</hi> or with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Wine,</hi> not yet ſpecificated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> An <hi>Eſſence</hi> is inquinated, when a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> or <hi>Eſſence</hi> is in greater than convenient quantity uſed in the extraction of another <hi>Eſſence,</hi> by which quantity the quality of the ſaid <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> is waſhed, waſted, and as it were inquinated; wherefore the ſuperfluity of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> muſt always be taken away, that the <hi>Eſſence</hi> may remain by it ſelf alone without any mixture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> An <hi>Eſſence</hi> is inquinated by extracting it with <hi>Air</hi> or <hi>mineral Menſtruums</hi> according to ſome Proceſſes of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. For an <hi>Acid,</hi> though it cannot be radically mix'd with any <hi>Eſſence,</hi> being no <hi>Eſſence</hi> it ſelf, yet is eaſily abſorbed or hidden by the aridity of <hi>mineral Eſſences,</hi> and ſo joyned with the ſaid <hi>Eſſences</hi> by accident, and from a thing otherwiſe innocent, creates a very ſtrong Poyſon: This therefore to remove, the Ancients firſt waſhed off that which ſtuck to the outſide of the Body, then tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted that which was more deeply admitted, by the digeſtion of <hi>Vegetable Menſtruums:</hi> But in the making of <hi>Eſſences</hi> with <hi>acid</hi> or <hi>mineral Menſtruums</hi> according to the reformed Proceſs, otherwiſe called by <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> the Proceſs of <hi>two Colours,</hi> the ſaid inquination of an <hi>Eſſence</hi> hath no place. In the beginning of this Proceſs the <hi>acid</hi> being abſorbed by the <hi>arid,</hi> becomes indeed the cauſe of venenoſity, as in the Proceſs of the Ancients; but when this Proceſs of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> is by induſtry and ingenuity raiſed to ſuch perfection, that no more <hi>Aridity</hi> can remain to hide any <hi>Acidity</hi> in it, but on the contrary, the whole Body is converted into two <hi>Oyls</hi> or <hi>Fats,</hi> from which all <hi>Acidity</hi> may eaſily be waſhed away with common Water, then is there no inquination to be feared from <hi>Acids.</hi> The Saying of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> we ſuppoſe is to be referred to this
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59727:136"/> Method, he having there treated of it on purpoſe, eſpecially having ſaid that the <hi>oleaginous Eſſences</hi> of <hi>Metals</hi> are to be extracted by <hi>Watry,</hi> that is, <hi>acid</hi> or <hi>corroſive Menſtruums,</hi> but that the <hi>watry Eſſences</hi> of Herbs, that is, leſs oyley in reſpect of <hi>Metals,</hi> muſt be made by <hi>Oleaginous,</hi> that is <hi>Vegetable Menſtruums,</hi> which things being not in common terms, but obſcurely enough deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, we do therefore leave them to be better explained by his Diſciples; but if they were to be underſtood according to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it would certainly be an Errour, not indeed to be connived at in the Prince of <hi>Adepts:</hi> But according to the Proverb, <hi>We are Men,</hi> &amp;c. For ſometimes good <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf has nodded, and the Pen of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> has wanted mending.</p>

                     <p>THe Philoſophical Vinegar, or Vinegar mix'd with the Spirit of <hi>Philoſophical Wine,</hi> which you acuated with Volatile Salts in the precedent Kind, is made ſtronger by the mixing of fixed Salts ſo called. We have deſcribed ſeveral Vegetable <hi>Menſtruums</hi> made with <hi>Alcali Salts</hi> in their fifth Kind, which if prepared with Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Vinegar inſtead of the Spirit of <hi>Philoſophical Wine,</hi> will produce Mineral <hi>Menſtruums</hi> of this Kind, though prepared another way, with this only difference, that they are made more ſlowly with the Spirit of <hi>Philoſophical Wine,</hi> but with Philoſophical Vinegar much ſooner, yea immediately, if either Common or Philoſophical Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar be joyned to the Vegetable <hi>Menſtruums. Aqua comendens,</hi> or <hi>Eating Water,</hi> is the third <hi>Menſtruum</hi> that we have obſerved to be made of common Salt. The firſt is in the fifth Kind of Vegetable
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59727:143"/> 
                        <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> where common Salt being fuſed and reſolved <hi>per deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium,</hi> is by Virtue of the Spirit of <hi>Philoſophical Wine</hi> reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Oyl or Eſſence of Salt, which by being ſometimes cohobated with the ſame Spirit, becomes ſweet, and is tranſmuted into the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> or <hi>Circulatum minus</hi> made of common <hi>Salt.</hi> The ſecond is in the fourteenth Kind, where the aforeſaid Oyl of <hi>Salt</hi> is left in its acid (rather ſaline) <hi>Eſſence.</hi> The third, which is taught in the preſent Kind, agrees with the firſt, except only that it is prepared not with the Spirit of <hi>Philoſophical Wine,</hi> but Philoſophical Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and ſo, ſooner than that, and in uſe is ſtronger, as a Mineral <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum.</hi> Diſſolve the <hi>Arcanum</hi> of Salt, or Salt circulated in any Acid not tinging; for example, common Vinegar diſtill'd, Spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Sulphur, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it will produce the Eating Water by ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple mixtion; on the contrary, if you weaken, or take away the Acid of the Eating Water, either by precipitating it with common Spirit of Wine, common Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or digeſting it by it ſelf, you will have the <hi>Arcanum</hi> of Salt, or Water of Salt circulated. That which has been ſaid of common Salt, is alſo to be underſtood of Niter, Alume, and all other Salts not tinging. The Receipt of the Eating Water is clear of it ſelf, except that in the Latin Tranſlation, <hi>a Salis Nitri Spiritu</hi> is read amiſs, the <hi>German</hi> Authors own Writing having it <hi>a Sale communi, Von gemeinen Saltz:</hi> The Error it is requiſite you ſhould correct.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Menſtruums</hi> of this Kind are made not only of Mineral Salts not tinging, but alſo of Vegetable <hi>Alcalies,</hi> thus:</p>

                        <hi>In the firſt place, let us admoniſh you to beware of this and ſuch like</hi> Menſtruums; <hi>for a Myſtery lies in theſe Receipts, which to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve is neceſſary, leſt you begin to doubt the Truth of them after many moſt dangerous Experiments tried in vain: for you Beginners let this ſuffice; that it is impoſſible for Wax, or any other oyley Matter to ſupply the place of the</hi> Spirit <hi>of</hi> Philoſophical Wine. <hi>There would be no need of this</hi> Spirit <hi>in the whole Art, if crude oyley things could perform the ſame as this moſt pure and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous Liquor.

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59727:147"/> the ſame Name, do prove the excellency of this</hi> Menſtruum. Now, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> we have a mind to teach you how and which way to joyn Soul, Body and Spirit together, ſo as to enter one into the other; for a Congregation of Contraries cannot be ſo, as to remain together without a Medium (<hi>which before in cap.</hi> 146. <hi>he called</hi> Sal Harmoniack <hi>or dry Water</hi>) Take an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the Dyers that dye Cloaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus it is with our Stone. Though we have rightly prepared the Body, Soul and Spirit, if they enter not into one another, they will neither now, nor at any time ever remain together without the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of our dry Water. Now Beloved, where now ſhall we find this Water? For <hi>Geber</hi> ſaith, Our water is not Rain-water. <hi>Ariſtotle ſaith,</hi> Our water is a dry water. <hi>Hermes ſaith,</hi> Our water is gathered out of a filthy and ſtinking <hi>Menſtrual Matter. Danthynus ſaith,</hi> Our water is found in old Stables, Houſes of Office, and ſtinking Sinks. And <hi>Morienus,</hi> Our water ſprings in Mountains and Valleys, and Fools underſtand not theſe words, but think it <hi>Mercury;</hi> it is not <hi>Mercury,</hi> it is a dry wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which cauſeth all Mineral Spirits, Soul and Body to enter and mix together, and when it has joyned them together, it departs from them, and lets them remain fixed. And this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is found in all things of the world. For if this water was not, in vain ſhould we endeavour to make the Stone: For how ſhould we make one of our prepared Matter enter into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? As the Apothecaries gather their Herbs together, ſo ought we to do either in the Vegetable, Animal, or Mineral Kingdom, to make a perfect work or Quinteſſence, we ought to have a dry water out of every diſtinct thing. A dry water therefore is in all things, to make themſelves perfect. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith <hi>Galen,</hi> All things have their own Medicine to make the Stone either in the Mineral, Animal, or Vegetable King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, without the addition of any exotick things. Wherefore when we would make the Stone, or any Fixation, we ought to make that conjunction with our dry water, as was ſaid of the Dyer and Apothecary. Therefore is it, my Beloved! that ſo many fall into Errors, becauſe they do not underſtand nor follow Nature: Therefore did I mention the Dyer and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, for you to underſtand Nature, by that rude way, that you may in your own mind perceive that no conjunction
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59727:148"/> can be made without a Medium.. Wherefore all the works above cited are good, but thoſe two things are not there na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that is, and <hi>Dry Water,</hi> weights and way of joyning, wherein conſiſts our whole Art: wherefore I conjure you never to reveal this Secret; for all the Art that is in the world is comprehended in it, to make the perfect work in a ſhort time and little pains, <hi>Cap.</hi> 147, 148, 149. 2. <hi>Oper.

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59727:155"/> the Mineral Nature is in coction the higheſt, becauſe the Metalick Liquor will be more and better united by coction with the Elementary Fire, than the other two aforeſaid Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Wherefore alſo, Metals do reſiſt common Fire, better than the other things comprehended under a Vegetable and Animal Nature, as you may ſee by Metals put into Fire, which do not Flame as Wood; for the Eſſence of it is not ſo cocted with Liquor, as the Metalick moiſture with its Eſſence; and the conjunction of the Liquor with the Eſſence is not Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talick, but ſimply Vegetable, which is conſumed in a black Fume. But when the Eſſence hath attained to coction by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then it remains not a Vegetable, but is now made a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talick, and is now conſumed in a white Fume by common Fire, no otherwiſe than as you ſee in perfect Metals, when they are melted in Fire, diſperſe a white Fume from them. Now conſider, <hi>ſaith</hi> Chortalaſſeus, <hi>or the Author of</hi> Arca ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cani Artificioſiſſimi, <hi>in his</hi> Cabula Chymica, <hi>pag.</hi> 369. <hi>Vol.</hi> 6. <hi>Th.

This is the Foundation of the whole Art, that is, for the <hi>Vegetable</hi> or <hi>Animal Spirit</hi> to leave its combuſtibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and become Incorruptible, and Immortal: This is the Key to open all Gates; here you have the true firſt matter of Gems, and Metals: Yet if I conſider this thing right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is not the firſt Matter, but a threefold extraction out of the firſt matter of Gems; and therefore you ought
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:59727:155"/> to praiſe God Eternally, and give him thanks in making you worthy of this matter, and vouchſafing you ſo much underſtanding, whereby to obtain to your uſe that which is the deepeſt in the Earth. I proceed in this firſt matter; which if you make Liquid, and open by the incombuſtible <hi>Vegetable Spirit (not common)</hi> you will be able to diſſolve Gold, Silver, all Minerals, and Gems in it, and make it melt like Ice in warm Water, deſtroy, mortifie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new it again; by this means I ſay, viſibly obtain, ſee, touch, and perceive an Aſtral Spirit (as a Lanthorn, wherein the Eternal Fire, and Virtue of the higheſt Star of Eternal Wiſdom dwelleth) you will I ſay, with your Eyes behold an inconſumptible Fire, ſhining Night and Day; Sun, Moon, Stars, Carbuncles, and a Splendor exceeding all manner of Fire; and obſerve the perfection of the whole Firmament in it. O man, my Creature! how great a Divine Gift, as that which is above all the Heavens, moſt excellently clear, and is moſt deep in the Earth, may you in a few Hours time obtain, whereas ſhe hath been a vaſt time employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, and in ſubtilty is far inferior to you, <hi>&amp;c.

                     <p>THE Antecedent Kind contained <hi>Mineral Menſtruums,</hi> compounded of Acid Spirits containing a Metalick Tincture in them; in thus preſent we uſe the Bodies of theſe Spirits, to make the <hi>Menſtruums</hi> a degree better. For a Tincture, for Example
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59727:157"/> extracted out of the dry part or body of Vitriol diſtilled, with the Spirit of <hi>Philoſophical Wine</hi> is an Eſſence, which being in the ſame diſtillation diſſolved in its own Acid Part, produced a <hi>Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> of this Kind; whereas in the Precedent Kind, that ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Copper, diſſolved or contained in common Spirit of Vitriol, and elevated with a violent Fire, is by the Spirit of <hi>Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Wine</hi> reduced not into the Eſſence, but Magiſtery, little effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al as well through the ſmalneſs of its quantity as Tincture: This preſent Oyl of Vitriol is not the leaſt eſteemed among the Secrets of <hi>Baſilius,</hi> and therefore we will a little more exactly conſider his moſt clear deſcription, that by his more abundant Light, we may Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate darker places. Firſt, <hi>Baſilius</hi> bids us purifie Roman Vitriol by divers ſolutions, and coagulations; which purification is neceſſary to ſeparate the Vitriol from ſtrange Duſt, Droſs, and other imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Offals; yet this we think Superfluous, when the Vitriol is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly criſtallized, for the Tereſtreity ſetling in the diſſolution of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, is not Foeces, but Copper, leſs diſſolved than the reſt, and left by the Acid, being too much diluted with common Water: The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol being purified, he enjoyns to be diſtilled with the Spirit of Wine into a red Oyl.</p>

De Vitriolo Veneris;</hi> but the following Kind of <hi>Menſtruum</hi> will prove that they are to be diſtilled with Philoſophical Vinegar: By theſe places compared together, we are better aſſured of divers things: Firſt that the Oyl of Vitriol is not any common Acid of Vitriol, though drawn out of Vitriol moſt exquiſitely purify'd, for the ſame Oyls may be made with the Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ols of all Metals by the ſame Spirit of Wine. Secondly, that common Spirit of Wine is altogether uſeleſs to this Work; but that the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical,</hi> or <hi>Menſtruum</hi> rather deſcribed in Numb. <hi>18.</hi> is meant by <hi>Baſilius</hi> by the Spirit of Wine. Moreover, that the Vitriols of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> do yield ſweet Oyls, becauſe made of ſome weak Acid, namely, common Vinegar, which is eaſily altered or tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this Philoſophical <hi>Menſtruum.</hi> But that the Oyls of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Metals, being made with ſtronger Acids, either Philoſophical Vinegar, or <hi>Mineral Menſtruums</hi> do remain Acid, eſpeciaily the preſent Oyl of Vitriol, in the diſtillation of which, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Philoſophical Wine,</hi> or <hi>Vegetable Menſtruum</hi> is diſſolved by the Natural Acid, or common Oyl of Vitriol, and with ſuch a prevalent Acidity, aſcends in the form of a red Oyl. Laſtly, that this Oyl of Vitriol is commended to us by <hi>Baſilius</hi> as a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> to be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with Gold; which we would have you take ſpecial notice of; for <hi>Baſilius</hi> hath here and there in his Books diſcovered many nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things concerning the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> of Vitriol, but moſt rarely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed the diſtillation of it with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Philoſophical Wine;</hi> yet without which all Proceſſes and Labours, all Endeavours and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments are vain, and of no importance in the more <hi>Secret Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi>

                     <p>For the making this Oyl of Vitriol the <hi>Adepts</hi> ſometimes diſſolved it in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Philoſophical Wine;</hi> which afterwards being cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallized, they called Vitriol corrected or graduated. Of this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or graduation of Vitriol <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> thus: <hi>The Deſcription of Vitriol,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is to be directed to</hi> Medicine <hi>and</hi> Alchymy: <hi>In</hi> Medicine <hi>it is an excellent Remedy: In</hi> Alchymy <hi>it is good for many other things; but the Art of</hi> Medicine <hi>and</hi> Alchymy, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts

At firſt,</hi> he proceeds, <hi>the Spirit of Vitriol being obtained, the cuſtom was to graduate it to the higheſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with being exalted, they cured the Epilepſie, whether new or old, in Men and Women, of what condition ſoever,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But let us return to the beginning, how the Spirit of Vitriol was found; Firſt they diſtilled the moiſt Spirit of Vitriol by it ſelf from the Colcothar, then they extended its degree by diſtilling and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating it alone to the higheſt, as the proceſs teacheth: Thus the Water began to be uſed for ſeveral Diſeaſes, as well Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal as External, as alſo for the Falling Sickneſs; ſo a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cure was performed: But thoſe that came after were much more diligent in the extraction; for they took the</hi> Spirit <hi>of</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, <hi>corrected as before, and diſtill'd it with the Colcothar eight or ten times with a moſt ſtrong Fire; ſo the dry Spirits were mixed with the moiſt: They urged the work ſo long, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually and without intermiſſion extracting, till the dry Spirits were over; then they graduated both Spirits, the moiſt as well as the dry, in a Phial together their own time: This Medicine they found to be of much greater operation againſt Diſeaſes, that they confounded all the Humoriſts in general: Yet is there ſome correction by Artiſts added by</hi> Spirit <hi>of</hi> Wine, <hi>for better penetration ſake, but of no higher degree: But I will commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to you my proceſs, which I commend to all Phyſitians, eſpecially for the Epilepſie, which hath the only cure in Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol; wherefore even the Charity of our Neighbour, requires us to appoint the more diligent care in that Diſeaſe: Now my Proceſs is for the</hi> Spirit <hi>of</hi> (Philoſophical) Wine <hi>to be imbibed by the Vitriol, and then diſtilled, as I ſaid, from the dry and moiſt Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But you muſt further know, that the aforeſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts of making the moiſt Spirit of Vitriol cannot be more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribed; for an Artiſt is required to underſtand it; thoſe ſordid Boylers do not in the leaſt underſtand a thing of ſo great moment. You muſt expect ſufficient information of all things, from Artiſts</hi> (of the more ſecret Chymy) Alchymiſts <hi>and</hi> Operators, <hi>ſo alſo to be more inſtructed by the ſame in the way of correcting the</hi> Spirit <hi>of</hi> Wine.</p>

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59727:169"/> Ounces and a half, put it to the ſecond Water by little and little gradually, ſeal the Mouth of the Glaſs well, that the Virtue of the <hi>Mercury</hi> put in may not ſuddenly exhale; put the Glaſs in Aſhes temperately hot, and the Water will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently begin to work upon the <hi>Mercury,</hi> diſſolving it and incorporating; and let the Glaſs ſtand thus in hot Aſhes, and in the diſſolution of the Water, till the Water appears no more, but has wholly diſſolved the Sublimed Mercury: Now the Water acts always upon Mercury by the way of imbibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till it diſſolves it totally: But take notice, if the Water cannot wholly diſſolve the Mercury put in, then lay aſide the Mercury that is diſſolved by that Water, and that which is not diſſolved at the bottom dry with a gentle Fire, grind, and diſſolve it with new Water as before, and thus repeat this Order, till all the Sublimed Mercury is diſſolved into Water: And then joyn all the ſolutions of that third Water, into one, in a clean Glaſs, and ſtop the Mouth of it well with Wax, and keep it carefully: This is the third Philoſophical thick qualified Water in the third degree of Perfection, and is the Mother of <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> which diſſolves all Bodies into their firſt Matter. Take the third clarifi'd Mercurial Water, qualifi'd in the third Degree of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, putrefie it in the Belly of a Horſe, to be well digeſted in a clear Glaſs with a long Neck, well ſealed the ſpace of 14 days, make it putrefie, and the Feces ſettle at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, then will this Water be tranſmuted from a Citrine to a Yellow Colour, which done, take out the Glaſs, put it in Aſhes with a moſt gentle heat, put on an Alembick with its Receiver, and begin to diſtil by little and little a moſt clear, clean, ponderous <hi>Aqua Vitae, Virgins Milk, moſt ſharp Vinegar,</hi> drop by drop, continuing conſtantly a ſlow Fire, till you have diſtilled all the <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> gently, then put out the Fire, let the Fornace cool, and keep it dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently apart. Behold this is <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> the <hi>Philoſophers Vinegar, Virgins Milk,</hi> by which Bodies are reſolved into their firſt Matter, which is called by infinite Names. The Signs of this Water are theſe, if a Drop be caſt upon a Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Plate red hot, it will preſently penetrate, and leave a White Impreſſion, it ſmoaks upon Fire, is coagulated in the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:59727:169"/> Air after the manner of Ice: and when this Water is diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Drops of it do not enter continually as other Drops, but one is diſtilled one way, another another way; this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acts not upon Metallick Bodies, as another ſtrong Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Water, which diſſolves Bodies into Water, but if Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies be put into this Water, it reduceth and reſolves them all into <hi>Mercury,</hi> as you ſhall hear hereafter.</p>

The Vitriol being thus prepared, Put it in a Glaſs Bottle or Egg, lute hermetically, but the Veſſels muſt be fill'd, that there may be no ſpace for the Spirits to elevate themſelves, ſet it on a Tripos, and there let it remain in a temperate heat, to ſubtiliate it ſelf: Then take out the Matter, and pulverize it, put it in a Cucurbit, put on an Alembick with a Receiver to it, and ſo diſtil in Balneo whatſoever will diſtil, it will be diſtilled in about 20 or 25 days: Then lay aſide the Diſtillation, take out the Feces lying at the bottom of the Cucurbit, grind them very fine upon a Stone, put them in a Diſſolving Veſſel, pour all the Diſtilled Water to them, ſeal hermetically, and it will be all diſſolved <hi>in Balneo</hi> without Feces; diſtil the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a Cucurbit through an Alembick <hi>in Balneo</hi> with a moderate heat, that all the Water may ſeparate it ſelf, which keep very choicely; continue the Diſtillation in Aſhes, that you may receive the Element of Air in the form of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry noble Citrine Oyl; and this muſt be done with a ſtrong Fire, lay aſide the Air by it ſelf very well ſtopped near the Water: The Feces being as red as Blood, take out of the Cucurbit, grind them to an Impalpable Powder upon a Stone, put them in a Glaſs Bottle or Egge, ſeal, and ſet it 30 days and nights on a Tripos to be ſubtiliated with a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate heat, then take out the Matter, grind it to Powder, put it in a Diſſolving Veſſel, pour to it the Element of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>(above diſtilled)</hi> ſeal, and put it <hi>in Balneo,</hi> to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as before; diſtil the Solution through an Alembick in Aſhes (the Receiver muſt be put into cold Water) increaſe the Fire by degrees, till at length it be hot; ſo let it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue five or ſix days, and in the mean time will aſcend the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fire in the form of a Red Oyl, ſuffer it to be cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three or four days, then take away the Receiver, keep it very well ſtopp'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>The firſt is concerning the choice of</hi> Vitriol, <hi>which Reaſon requires as well as the antecedent Receipt to be graduated, that is, diſſolved either in the Spirit of Philoſophical Wine, or Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Vinegar, and Criſtallized, for the Calcination of common Vitriol, diſſolved in common Water, and purified, in a cloſe Veſſel to a moſt red colour, is altogether Impoſſible, and of no Efficacy neither; for nothing but the common Acid or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Spirit of Vitriol is extracted out of common Vitriol, be it never ſo well purified and calcined: Vitriol therefore well Purged in common Water, is to be choſen according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Receipt, but after that, according to the antecedent well diſſolved in Philoſophical Vinegar, that it may be thereby made graduated Vitriol, and the fit Matter of this Menſtruum.</hi>

                        <hi>The ſecond Branch treats of the calcination or fixation of this graduated</hi> Vitriol <hi>into redneſs: Corncerning which, the former proceſs was too obſcure, but the preſent or later clear enough: This Calcination is the true and Philoſophical way of fixing this</hi> Vitriol, <hi>and that chiefly, becauſe citrinity and redneſs follow blackneſs and whiteneſs, the true ſigns of volatilization as well as fixation, of which</hi> Tho.

                        <hi>As to the Permanence of the red colour in the Philoſophers Stone, he declares the following Notions:</hi> In Multiplication, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> no blackneſs intervenes, nor do any Colours of the World ſhew themſelves, nor any Whiteneſs, nor in Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation does any thing ſhew it ſelf beſides redneſs, nor in fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation does any Colour ſhew its ſelf except its own, that is, an egregious redneſs: For the Stone hath no other Colour but redneſs, for it is one only ſubſtance, one ſingle matter, and as the Heaven invincible: You muſt alſo know, tho it were ſublimed, it would not be deprived of all its fixity, for when the Stone is made and prepared in the utmoſt vertue of it, then can it not be changed out of its own Eſſence into another, for if the Stone could be changed or drawn out of its own Eſſence into another Eſſence or Nature, it would not

                     <p>Iſaacus <hi>being perhaps perſwaded of an unalterable conſtancy of redneſs obſerved in the Multiplication of the Stone of higher Degree or Kind, concludes the Philoſophers Stone to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and abſolutely immutable: which Opinion to defend in every part, he has ſooner ventured to deny the volatilization it ſelf of the Stone, than give way to the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">

                        <hi>What we have againſt this Opinion, we will reſerve for the Third Book; in the mean time it will be requiſite for you to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this one thing: That the Matter of Calcined Vitriol, as alſo of the Philoſophers Stone, multiplied, remains for everred, but not fixed, becauſe either of them may be volatilized with</hi> Philoſophical Menſtruums. <hi>But let them be how they will, the Vitriol of Saturn fixed the ſame way by the ſame Author, will prove that the graduated Vitriol of Venus, calcined to redneſs in a cloſe Veſſel is fixed.</hi> Take, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> a Glaſs Viol, put in it one half of Purged Saturn <hi>(Sugar of Saturn made not with common Diſtilled Vinegar, but Philoſophical)</hi> reſerve the other part by it ſelf till you have occaſion, put a fit Glaſs to the mouth of the Viol, and put the Glaſs in ſifted Aſhes in a Fornace, of <hi>Tripos Arcanorum,</hi> or on a Fornace wherein
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:59727:176"/> you calcine Spirits; give it a Fire as hot as the Sun is at Mid-ſummer, no more, except by chance a little hotter or colder, provided it be not ſo great as to melt the Lead, for ſo your Matter would be liquid as Oyl, and ſhould it ſtand ſo the ſpace of 12 days, all the Sulphur would fly away, and the Matter be corrupted, for the Sulphur of it is not yet fixed, and on the outſide only, and therefore the Matter is moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily melted, and though it be pure, yet is it not fixed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fire muſt be ſo gentle as not to melt the Matter; let it ſtand ſo the ſpace of Six Weeks, after which take a little, project it upon a hot Iron, if it preſently melts and fumes, it is not yet fixed, but if it remains, the Sulphur of it is fixed: Then increaſe the Fire notably, till your Matter becomes citrine, and ſo continually till it grows red, ſtill increaſing the Fire till it attains to the colour of Rubies; increaſe till it is red hot, and then is it fixed, and prepared for Infuſion, with the Noble Water of Paradiſe (the <hi>Menſtruum deſcribed in Numb.</hi> 114.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Beſides this, there is indeed another way alſo of calcining</hi> Philoſophical Vitriol, <hi>which is done in an open Veſſel; thus graduated Verdigreſe is calcined to redneſs before the Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of it, in the preparation of the Spirit of</hi> Venus <hi>of</hi> Baſilius, <hi>as we have obſerved in the precedent Kind, but this belongs not to this place, for the</hi> Calx <hi>remains volatile, not fixed, which way of Calcining was invented meerly for the ſeperation of the</hi> Phlegme.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The third Branch conſiſts in a new diſſolution of this fixed</hi> Vitriol <hi>in</hi> Philoſophical Vinegar, <hi>for which Reaſon this</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol <hi>is volatilized again, and made fit for Diſtillation, in the former Receipt, this Solution is wholly omitted, but more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly deſcribed in the</hi> latter Proceſs.</p>

But if you would extract an Oyl out of Metals, as has been taught of <hi>Vitriol;</hi> you muſt diſſolve your Metal in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and make it precipitate, and waſh away the Saltneſs of it with common Water, and being dryed, put into a Glaſs with a long Neck, and congealed, and put upon a <hi>Fornace</hi> with Sifted Aſhes, make a Fire under it as for <hi>Vitriol,</hi> till the Metal be alogether red, and till the inſide of it is turn'd out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: Then diſſolve it in Diſtil'd Vinegar, as the <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and <hi>Congeal,</hi> till no more Feces remain: Then diſtil, and the Metal will wholly diſtil into a Red Oyl, and it is the perfect Oyl of the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> but the Projection of it is not ſo high, as of the Oyl which was firſt Salt: And the Oyl of every Metal you muſt Multiply with the Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> as aforeſaid: And the Oyl is very eaſily made after the ſame manner out of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and the Projection of it is very high: Give thanks to God, Work, and remember the Poor, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the gifts of God to your own Salvation, <hi>Cap.</hi> 80. 2. <hi>Oper.

Thus you may Diſtil it through an <hi>Alembick</hi> into a Red Oyl. As you was here taught concerning <hi>Vitriol,</hi> ſo muſt you alſo do with all Metals, as alſo <hi>Mercury,</hi> when it is diſſolved in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> and precipitated, the Saltneſs waſh'd away and dried, put it in a Glaſs, as was ſaid of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and done moreover ſo, as was taught before concerning <hi>Vitriol.</hi> And that which is here declar'd of Metal, you may alſo do with <hi>Antimony (and all other Minerals.)</hi> Open your Ears, and hearken, and open

                        <hi>The</hi> Menſtruum <hi>immediately antecedent in</hi> Numb. 125, <hi>is in all things clear, except the firſt Branch of it, wherein is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the neceſſary Diſſolution of</hi> Vitriol <hi>in</hi> Philoſophical Vinegar, <hi>before the Calcination of it into redneſs or fixation. The firſt</hi> Menſtruum <hi>of this Kind is imperfect, not indeed in this, but in another Branch, inſomuch as it is not therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that</hi> Vitriol <hi>muſt after the Calcination of it, be again Diſſolved in</hi> Philoſophical Vinegar. <hi>In this preſent third, Tho it be ſaid, that it ought to be made according to the rule of the precedent</hi> Menſtruums, <hi>there is no mention at all made of</hi> Philoſophical Vinegar, <hi>yet without it,</hi> Vitriol <hi>can neither be fixed into redneſs, nor when fixed, be again Volatalized or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled. The Receipts therefore muſt be compared as often as the Adepts have either through too much fear or envy left us them imperfect: It is enough, if by comparing them together, we can pick out their meaning or intention, being not fully enough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in every circumſtance, the terms being either too obſcure, or altogether omitted.

Now by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the method, it is manifeſt that the myſtery of the Receipts conſiſts in the</hi> Vinegar, <hi>but to remove all ſcruple from theſe moſt excellent</hi> Menſtruums, <hi>we will prove by the very words of</hi> Iſaacus <hi>himſelf, that he meant not a common but</hi> Philoſophical Menſtruum. Have not I taught you, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> how to draw all Metals through the <hi>Alembick,</hi> ſo as to Diſtil wholly into Oyl, leaving nothing; but that alone does the ſtrong Spirit of Vinegar, and makes them <hi>(Metals)</hi> to be perfectly ſeparated and rectified from their Feces, within and without, as I taught you, and that the inſide ſhould be outward, and the outſide inward, and then they are ſo reſolved and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, that the Elements cannot be ſeparated one from another; if you ſought all the means in the world, you would not be able to ſeparate theſe Elements, by reaſon of their ſubtility, cleanneſs and reſolution; and when they have the ſubtil pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating Vinegar with them, they paſs all together through the <hi>Alembick</hi> with the <hi>Vinegar;</hi> but if you ſhould put them to fire, and any Spirit of Vinegar <hi>(in ſufficient quantity)</hi> was preſent, they <hi>(the Metal and Vinegar)</hi> would be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with fixed together; and becauſe the Vinegar is copiouſly in their clean, open, ſubtil Body, they diſtil into Oyl, and the Spirits of the Vinegar are fixed with the Body: Now you muſt know thdt the Spirit of Vinegar is more Subtil than all things in the World, yea, a thouſand times more ſubtil than

                     <p>To alledge all, that the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> have ſaid of the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Nature of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> would be too much, peruſe <hi>Baſilius</hi> alone, eſpecially the <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>fifth</hi> Chapter, <hi>De Rebus Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalibus &amp; Supernaturalibus,</hi> as alſo in the <hi>Elucidation of the</hi> 12. <hi>Keyes,</hi> and you will find <hi>Vitriol</hi> more eſteemed by him than any Gold, for his Doctrine is that the Tincture of the <hi>Vitriol</hi> of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> is far better than the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> not indeed in its Kind, for it is one and the ſame in all, but that this Tincture is in the Natural as well as Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <hi>Vitriol</hi> of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> higher, and more noble in Colour, more abundant in Quantity, of eaſier Separation from its Body, in Preparation, and of leſs Charge in the uſe, than the <hi>Tincture</hi> that is in Gold.</p>

And this Vegetable <hi>Mercury (Vegetable Menſtruum)</hi> cannot penetrate a Body, ſo as to complete the diſſolution of it, except the Body be firſt made ſpongy; but no Lead is ſo ſpongy, nor ſo ſubtil, as Red Lead or Minium <hi>(Vitriol calcined)</hi> and therefore if we would not be fruſtrated of our expectation, it is neceſſary for us to take Red Lead, that is, <hi>Antimony</hi> prepared, which is more ſpongy and ſubtil, than any other Lead. For the <hi>(Vegetable)</hi> Water will ſuddenly penetrate into it, and diſſolve the moſt ſubtil parts of it.

Common Verdegreſe reduced into</hi> Vitriol <hi>by Vinegar, then three times diſſolved in common Water, and coagulated, muſt be calcined to redneſs in an open Veſſel, that the ſuperfluous</hi> Phlegm <hi>may be drawn away, and made fitter for the enſuing Diſtillation. But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever calcined</hi> Verdegreſe <hi>purified, in</hi> Apothecaries Shops, <hi>call'd the flowers of</hi> Verdegreſe, <hi>to redneſs, without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of its Virtues? Who I ſay has diſtil'd a moſt Red Oyl out of this calcined Powder?</hi> Verdegreſe <hi>therefore muſt be diſſolved not in common, but</hi> Philoſophical Vinegar, <hi>in order to be not only purified, but reduced alſo into</hi> Vitriol, <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duated to the higheſt. In the</hi> 20th <hi>Kind,</hi> Baſilius <hi>diſtils the ſame Red Oyl of</hi> Venus, <hi>ponderous as Lead or Gold, thick as Blood, and of a fiery quality; that is, of extream acidity, out of</hi> Roman Vitriol <hi>being highly graduated, that is, either macerated, or throughly diſſolved in the Spirit of</hi> Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Wine. <hi>In the</hi> 21th <hi>Kind, We took Notice, that the ſame</hi> Vitriol <hi>of</hi> Copper <hi>or</hi> Verdegreſe <hi>being purified with common Vinegar, was reduced into a graduated</hi> Vitriol, <hi>not indeed by the Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine <hi>alone, but with the juice of Sowre Grapes, that is, mix'd with common Vinegar, or ſome other ſtronger Acid, and then diſtilled into the Oyl of</hi> Venus. <hi>If Metals, Minerals, and all other Acids diſſolved in acids, and reduced into</hi> Vitriols, <hi>be ſo graduated with the Spirit of</hi> Philoſophical Wine <hi>or</hi> Philoſophical Vinegar, <hi>that the deſired Oyls may be drawn from them, the reaſon why</hi> Vitriols <hi>alone made of</hi> Copper, <hi>ſhould be deprived of the ſaid Priviledge, cannot eaſily be apprehended: It matters not whether</hi> Vitriol <hi>be graduated according to the method given in</hi> Numb. 113. <hi>or according to the preſcription of the preſent Receipt, for the ſame Spirit and Oyl is produced either way.</hi>

                     <p>YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> have now in this Book obſerved the <hi>Uſe</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Philoſophical Wine,</hi> as alſo of moſt <hi>Menſtruums</hi> in theſe ways of making <hi>Menſtruums:</hi> hereafter, in the following Books you will perceive them to be ſufficient for every purpoſe. By theſe means you will make all the Medicines of the <hi>Adepts,</hi> reduce all Metals into running Mercury, or if you had rather, into the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers Mercury, or firſt Matter of Metals. By theſe will you make as well univerſal as particular Tranſmutatives of Metals, the beſt of all in reſpect of deeper Tincture, ſhortneſs of Time, and conciſeneſs of Work. Hereby laſtly, will you prepare whatſoever curioſity has been left us by the <hi>Adepts,</hi> and preſcribed in their Books, ſo that if they have any Preparations without the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Philoſophical Wine,</hi> you may decline them without any dammage: For theſe <hi>Menſtruums</hi> do volatilize all fixed Bodies, and fix the volatile and volatilized, diſſolve the coagulated, and coagulate the diſſolved: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder which few Notions are comprehended all the Operations of the more <hi>Secret Chymy.</hi>

                     <p>THat <hi>Mineral Menſtruums</hi> are corroſive, and therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve Bodies with ebullition, is clearly manifeſt by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts aforeſaid.

                     <head>VIII. That theſe <hi>Menſtruums</hi> are permanent, yea fixed with Things diſſolved in them.</head>
                     <p>IT is by the former deſcriptions of <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> manifeſt, that as well the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Philoſophical Wine,</hi> as <hi>Menſtruums</hi> made of it, do ſtick to the things diſſolved in them. There is indeed no better Argument to confirm the excellency of <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> than that they are homogeneous and permanent with things diſſolved, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:59727:199"/> Diſſolvents tranſmutable with the diſſolved into a third ſubſtance different from both: Theſe <hi>Menſtruums</hi> therefore are ſo far from being immutable, that, according to the Edict of the whole Crowd of Philoſophers, to wit, <hi>The diſſolution of the Body is the coagulation of the Spirit, and ſo on the contrary,</hi> nothing in the more <hi>Secret Chymy,</hi> can be more infallible. Now this permanence of <hi>Menſtruums</hi> you have obſerved not only in the volatilizations of <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> but alſo in the fixations of ſome, thus you had the fixati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Philoſophical Wine</hi> in the greater <hi>Circulatums</hi> of the <hi>Ninth,</hi> and <hi>Two and Twentieth Kinds;</hi> but you will find more in the Preparations of Medicines, as well as Tinctures. They were by an Analogy of the Ancients ill called <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> unleſs alſo they could be transformed into the ſubſtance of an <hi>Embryo,</hi> and yield proper Nutriment and augmentation to the Infant: The <hi>Spirit</hi> of our <hi>Wine</hi> is indeed an abſolute <hi>Oleoſum,</hi> that is, combuſtible, but here being throughly mixed with <hi>Aridums,</hi> it becomes incombuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and deſpiſeth the violence of Fire: It is alſo moiſt, and ſo uncapable of fixation; but the moiſter and thinner parts, which it contains, are ſeparated in the work of fixation from the more Oyley Particles being now concentrated. So you obſerved, that, in the Preparations of the <hi>Sal Harmoniacks,</hi> or <hi>Sulphurs</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Philoſophical Wine,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Vegetable,</hi> as well as <hi>Mineral Menſtruums</hi> are partly reduced into inſipid Water, and partly ſticking to the Matters left in the bottom, and fixed: But better Examples you will have both in the Second and Third Books.</p>

<pb n="376" facs="tcp:59727:200"/> into its own Nature, and ſo multiplies its ſelf by this means.
